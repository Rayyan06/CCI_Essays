My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path here was a process of discovery. Initially drawn to Computer Science for the challenge of building full-stack applications, I missed the hands-on experience of physical systems. However, purely mechanical projects lacked the algorithmic complexity I was looking for. Working at my father's firm, I built circuits that merged both worlds, sensors feeding data to microcontrollers, logic driving actuators, and everything clicked. Control Systems satisfy both interests, connecting physical dynamics to code.

Looking back, the signs were always there. As a teenager, I spent hours sketching graphs, inventing rules for imaginary stock markets, modeling COVID case counts, and tracking weather patterns as a window into atmospheric dynamics. I was obsessed with how inputs, outputs, and feedback shape systems over time. I just didn't know it was a field I could build my career around.

I am building towards this target academically. Currently finishing foundational engineering coursework including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics, I deliberately added mechanical courses such as Thermodynamics and Statics, to understand the physical systems I intend to control. Next fall, I transfer to RPI for their co-terminal BS/MS program in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, targeting a specialization in control systems. Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

Through personal projects, I have developed skills in C++, embedded logic, and sensors, but I've worked on a hobbyist scale. CCI offers the bridge to mission-critical engineering. I want to learn how control architectures achieve the robustness required of particle accelerators, expanding my toolkit from microcontrollers to FPGAs. Beyond technical skills, the 10-week internship offers collaboration with physicists, engineers, and technicians. I'm also eager to participate in the seminars and workshops, an environment to ask questions and learn how large research teams operate.

In short, CCI is the bridge between where I am and where I'm headed. I'll return to RPI next fall with hands-on experience, clear research direction, and confidence in my path forward.
