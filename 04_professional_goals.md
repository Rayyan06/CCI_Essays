My long term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D engineer working with scientists designing instrumentation and control systems at a National Lab. I'm eager to move on from my current small scale projects to large scale scientific instrumentation. Even in my personal and class projects, I have realized the importance of optimization in data acquisition and controls where every millisecond counts. I aim to apply this mindset to large-scale projects, ensuring precision and accuracy in critical measurements.

Currently, as I finish my foundational engineering coursework this spring, including Differential Equations and Circuit Analysis, my next academic step will be transferring to RPI. I have already consulted with the RPI Transfer Director regarding their BS+MS program that will allow me to earn both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE) on an accelerated timeline. I am specifically targeting the ECSE curriculum to specialize in control theory. I plan to take upper level courses such as ECSE 4440 (Control Systems Engineering) to understand the theory, and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time applications) to learn how to implement the theory on embedded hardware. After mastering these fundamentals, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

However, I've realized that in engineering, academic knowledge is insufficient without real world application. I'm applying to CCI to bridge this gap. An internship at a National Lab is key to the hands-on experience I'm seeking in instrumentation and control systems. I want to gain exposure to industrial-grade hardware and laboratory infrastructure that is unavailable at my community college. I've always been obsessed with optimization, instrumentation, and control, and spending 10 weeks working on the lab's electronics and infrastructure is the immersive environment I need to confirm this career path.

Ultimately, my passion lies at the intersection of computer programming, mathematical theory, and electromechanical systems. I aim to master high performance technologies like FPGAs and ASICs. Participating in the CCI program will allow me to test my skills on a multidisciplinary team, moving from managing student projects to contributing to the scientific mission of the DOE.
