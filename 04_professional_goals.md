My long term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D engineer working with scientists designing instrumentation and control systems at a National Lab. I'm eager to move on from my current small scale projects to large scale scientific instrumentation. Even in my personal and class projects, I have realized the importance of optimization in data acquisition and controls, every millisecond counts. I aim to apply this mindset to large-scale projects, ensuring precision and accuracy in critical measurements.

Currently, as I finish my foundational engineering coursework this spring, including Differential Equations and Circuit Analysis, my next step will be transferring to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I have already consulted with the RPI Transfer Director regarding their BS+MS program that will allow me to earn both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE) on an accelerated timeline. I am specifically targeting the ECSE curriculum because it aligns with my career focus, and I plan to take specialized upper level courses such as ECSE 4440 (control systems engineering), and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time applications). These courses will provide the theoretical basis I need to design cutting-edge systems. After mastering these fundamentals, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the cutting edge of research in the field.

However, I've realized that in Engineering, academic knowledge is insufficient without real world application. I'm applying to the CCI program to bridge this gap. An internship at a National Lab is key to the hands-on experience I'm seeking in instrumentation and control systems. I want to gain exposure to these systems that I don't have access to at my community college. I've always been obsessed with optimization, instrumentation, and control, and spending 10 weeks working on the labs electronics and infrastructure is the immersive environment I need to hone in my career path.

Ultimately, I am drawn to Electronics & Control Systems because they are at the intersection of computer programming, mathematical theory and physical functions. I want to gain exposure to technologies like FPGAs, VLSI, high frequency data acquisition because I find it fascinating. Participating in the CCI program will allow me to test my skills on a multidisciplinary team, moving from managing class & club projects to contributing to the scientific mission of the DOE.
