My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path to this field was a process of discovery. Initially, I was drawn to CS for its rigorous logic and problem solving, but I missed the hands-on feedback of physical machinery. Conversely, when I worked on purely mechanical projects, I missed the algorithmic complexity of code. I discovered that Controls Systems is the niche that satisfies both of my interests. It connects physical reality (dynamic systems) to mathematical logic (programming). I realized that my passion lies at this exact intersection.

To achieve this, I am building a rigorous academic foundation. Currently, I'm finishing foundational engineering coursework including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics. I'm deliberately taking mechanical courses to build a broad understanding of the physical systems I intend to control. Next fall, I transfer to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I have already consulted with the Transfer Director regarding their Co-Terminal BS/MS Program, aiming to earn both degrees in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE). I am ensuring my transfer credits are structured to meet eligibility for this accelerated timeline. I plan to take specialized upper-level courses such as ECSE 4440 (Control Systems) and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time Applications). Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

However, I recognize a critical gap in my journey: scale. While I have developed skills in C++, embedded logic, and sensors through personal projects, I lack exposure to the industrial technologies that define "Big Science". I am applying to CCI to bridge the gap between hobbyist prototyping and mission-critical engineering. I need to learn how to design architectures that are not just functional, but robust enough to support experiments like PIP-II. I want to expand my toolkit from microcontrollers to high-performance FPGAs and ASICs, learning to work on distributed systems unavailable in a standard classroom.

Participating in the CCI program is the essential bridge between my current and goals. It will allow me to test my skills on a multidisciplinary team, transitioning from managing student projects to contributing directly to the scientific mission of the DOE.
