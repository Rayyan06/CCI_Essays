My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path to this field was a process of discovery. Initially, I was drawn to CS for its rigorous logic and problem solving, but I missed the hands-on feedback of physical machinery. Conversely, when I worked on purely mechanical projects, I missed the algorithmic complexity of code. I discovered that Controls Systems is the niche that satisfies both of my interests. It connects physical reality (dynamic systems) to mathematical logic (programming). I realized that my passion lies at this exact intersection.

To achieve this, I am building a rigorous academic foundation. Currently, I'm finishing foundational engineering coursework including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics. I'm deliberately taking mechanical courses as well, such as Thermodynamics, to build a broad understanding of the mechatronic systems I intend to control. Next fall, I transfer to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I have already consulted with the Transfer Director regarding their Co-Terminal BS/MS Program, aiming to earn both degrees in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE). I am ensuring my transfer credits are structured to meet eligibility for this accelerated timeline. I plan to take specialized upper-level courses such as ECSE 4440 (Control Systems) and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time Applications). Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

Through personal projects, I have developed skills in C++, embedded logic, and sensors, but I've worked on a hobbyist scale. CCI offers the bridge to mission-critical engineering. I want to learn how control architectures achieve the robustness required of particle accelerators, expanding my toolkit from microcontrollers to FPGAs and ASICs. This is the gap between prototyping and "Big Science" that I'm ready to close.

CCI is the bridge between where I am and where I'm headed, testing my skills on a multidisciplinary team, while contributing to the scientific mission of the DOE.
