My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path here was a process of discovery. Initially drawn to Computer Science for the satisfaction(satisfaction?? err) of building full-stack applications, I missed the hands-on experience of physical systems. Purely mechanical work lacked the algorithmic complexity I was looking for. Working at my father's firm, I built circuits that merged both world, sensors feeding data to microcontrollers, logic driving actuators, and everything clicked. Control Systems satisfy both interests, connecting physical dynamics to code.

Looking back, the signs were always there. As a teenager, I spent hours sketching graphs, inventing rules for imaginary stock markets, modeling COVID case counts, and tracking weather patterns as a window into atmospheric dynamics. I was obsessed with how inputs, outputs, and feedback shape systems over tim. I just didn't know it was a field I could build my career around.

I am building towards this academically. Currently finishing foundational engineering coursework including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics, I deliberately added mechanical courses such as Thermodynamics and Statics, to understand the the physical systems I intend to control. Next fall, I transfer to RPI for their co-terminal BS/MS program in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, targeting a specialization in control systems. Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

Through personal projects, I have developed skills in C++, embedded logic, and sensors, but I've worked on a hobbyist scale. CCI offers the bridge to mission-critical engineering. I want to learn how control architectures achieve the robustness required of particle accelerators, expanding my toolkit from microcontrollers to FPGAs. Beyond technical skills, CCI offers collaboration with physicists, engineers, and technicians, the interdisciplinary environment I need to thrive in research.

CCI is the bridge between where I am and where I'm headed. I'll return to RPI next fall with hands-on experience, clear research direction, and confidence in my path forward.
