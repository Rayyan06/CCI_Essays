My long term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D engineer working with scientists designing instrumentation and control systems at a National Lab. I'm eager to move on from my current projects such as self balancing robots and encoders to the large scale scientific instrumentation. Even in my small projects, I have realized the importance of optimization in data acquisition and controls, every millisecond counts, so when I move on to bigger projects I'll keep that in mind to ensure accurate readings.

Here at Community College, I'm finishing my requirements this spring like Differential Equations, Circuit Analysis. After that, my next academic step is transferring to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to complete my Bachelors. I have consulted with the Transfer Director of Admissions about an option to complete a BS + MS in ECSE (Electrical & Computer Engineering) alongside my Bachelors. I am specifically targeting the **ECSE** curriculum because it relates closely to my target career, and I plan to take specialized upper level courses such as **ECSE 4440** (control systems engineering), and ECSE 4760. This will give me the theoretical knowledge I need to work on cutting edge systems. After mastering these fundamentals, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the cutting edge of research in the field.

However, through my experience so far, I know that academic knowledge is not enough, having exposure to the hardware is the solution. Spending time at a National Lab like Fermilab will be the key to the hands-on experience I'm looking for in instrumentation and control systems. Ultimately, I seek a career serving the scientific mission of the DOE. Spending time working on these systems and gaining exposure will also help me understand exactly what areas I want to focus on once I transfer after my summer internship. I've always been obsessed with optimization, instrumentation, and control, and I hope I can achieve this. 

I fell in love with Electronics & control systems because they are at the intersection of computer programming, mathematical theory and physical functions. I want to gain exposure to technologies like FPGA's, VLSI's, high frequency data acquisition because I find it fascinating. Also, the idea of working on a huge team with many different specialists on cutting edge engineering projects is incredibly compelling. This is why i've been getting involved in as many team based projects as I can, and I plan to attend competitions as part of my club, group. It's been fun managing and working with team members.
