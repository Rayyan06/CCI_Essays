My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path here was a process of discovery. Originally fascinated by the challenge and accomplishment of building full-stack apps and GUIs, I thought that Computer Science suited me best. But I missed the hands-on experience of working with hardware. Mechanical projects alone felt incomplete, lacking the algorithmic complexity that made software projects captivating. Working at my father's firm, I built circuits that merged both worlds: sensors fed data to microcontrollers, logic drove actuators, and everything clicked like clockwork. Control Systems satisfies both interests, connecting physical dynamics and circuits to code.

Looking back, the signs were always there. As a teenager, I spent hours sketching graphs, inventing rules for imaginary stock markets, modeling COVID case counts, and tracking weather patterns as a window into atmospheric dynamics. I was obsessed with how inputs, outputs, and feedback shape systems over time. I just didn't know it was a field I could build my career around.

I am building towards this target academically. Currently, I'm finishing foundational engineering coursework including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics. I deliberately took mechanical courses such as Thermodynamics and Statics, to understand the physical systems I intend to control. Next fall, I transfer to RPI for their co-terminal BS/MS program in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, targeting a specialization in control systems. Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

Through personal projects, I have developed skills in C++, embedded logic, and sensors, but I've worked on a hobbyist scale. CCI offers the bridge to mission-critical engineering. I want to learn how control architectures achieve the robustness required of particle accelerators, expanding my toolkit from microcontrollers to FPGAs. Beyond technical skills, the 10-week internship offers collaboration with physicists, engineers, and technicians. I'm also eager to participate in the seminars and workshops, an environment where I can ask questions and learn how large research teams operate.

CCI is the bridge between where I am and where I'm headed. I'll return to RPI next fall with hands-on experience, clear research direction, and confidence in my path forward.
