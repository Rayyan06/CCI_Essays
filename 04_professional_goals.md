My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path to this field was a process of discovery. Initially, I was drawn to CS for its .... However, I found out I missed the hands-on feedback of physical machinery. Conversely, when I worked on purely mechanical projects, I missed the algorithmic complexity of code. I discovered that controls systems is the niche that satisfies both interests. It connects Physical reality (dynamic systems) to mathematical logic (programming). I realized that my passion lies at this exact intersection.

To achieve this, I am building a rigorous academic foundation. Currently, I'm finishing foundational engineering coursework including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics. I'm deliberately taking mechanical courses to build a broad understanding of the physical systems I intend to control. Next fall, I transfer to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I have already consulted with the Transfer Director regarding their Co-Terminal BS+MS Program that will allow me to earn both degrees in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE) on an accelerated timeline. I plan to take specialized upper-level courses such as ECSE 4440 (Control Systems) and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time Applications). Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

However, I recognize a critical gap in my journey: scale. While I have developed skills in C++, embedded logic, and sensors through personal projects, I lack exposure to the industrial technologies that define scientific experimentation. I am applying to CCI to bridge the gap between hobbyist prototyping and mission-critical engineering. Working in a big team will gain me access to the professional planning and tracking tools to ensure reliability in big projectts, designing architectures taht are not just functional, but robust. Spending 10 weeks at a National Lab will expand my technical toolkit from the hobbyist microcontroller level to the professional high-performance FPGAs and ASICs. 

Participating in the CCI program is the essential bridge between my current and goals. Itwill allow me to test my skills on a multidisciplinary team.....
