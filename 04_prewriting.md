Phase 3: Program dive
Program: CCI Internship at Fermilab
Projects: Advanced FPGA programming, PIP-II Low Level RF Hardware Development, Optimizing Linac performance with ML and instrumentation, Beam Instrumentation engineering software
Departmetns i'm interested in : Controls, Instrumentation

Phase 4:
This summer, I will learn FPGA programming on the PIP-II accelerator
This summer, I will learn advanced C++ control systems on the beam sensor and hardware systems
This summer, I will learn ...
This will allow me to transfer to RPI and complete my bachelors in Electrical Engineering when I come to it after the summer 2026, i'm transferring in fall 2026
This foundation is essential for my goal of becooming a lead/R&D engineer who solves control systems and instrrumentaieon problems?

What is my big why? IDK LOL
deram job: IDK LOL
Missing link: IDK what i want to even do
why this program: Looks damn cool, I LOVE roobtics and control systems and working with hardware and software so ya

Professional Goals

Audience: Hiring managers / Engineer or scientist Mentors

Statement of Purpose work:
Information to Include
Introduce yourself and your academic interests
Provide simple background information on your area of interest and how it became of particular interest to you.
(yes, belongs here)
Here you can also share with them how and why you decided to pursue a graduate degree in this field.
(belongs here)

belongns in technical experience:
Describe your academic background, preparation, and training
Discuss skills you have learned from academic, lab, or research experiences (e.g., undergraduate coursework, research opportunities, scholarly writings, jobs in the field, presentations, etc.). 

Whenever possible, give specific examples and illustrate the points you are making, don’t just simply tell them. Examples of skills to highlight through specific examples include your ability to set and accomplish reasonable yet ambitious goals, receive and acting upon constructive feedback, navigate and learn from setbacks, work collaboratively as well as independently, and communicate about your interests across different audiences. 

Talk about research you conducted – project title or focus, research mentor, your specific role, what you learned and the outcome. If there were challenges, don’t be afraid to mention what you learned from them. This shows persistence and resilience in the face of adversity– these are also things they are looking for!

List important papers or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your academic degree requirements.

Share relevant work or internship experience as related to the field you are applying to.

Show them you are making an informed decision

(include, in pro goals essay)
Indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in the discipline and are aware of research trends.

(technical interests):
Show them that you have thoroughly researched the program, its faculty, and research focus areas, and why you are applying to this program specifically. This will help you write a more informed essay that is relatable to the faculty who will be reviewing your application.

(personal experience and technical interests):
Describe why you are a good fit for the program and why the program is a good fit for you.

(technical interests):
If there are specific faculty you are interested in working with, check the program’s ASOP instructions and determine how best to mention this in your essay. Some programs require you to name a professor(s) with whom you would like to work.

professional goals relevance:
Are there any aspects of the program that are of particular interest to you (immersion program, opportunities for collaboration with others outside of the institution, research centers associated with the program, etc.)?

Include information that is important to you outside of the program – supportive environment for first-year students, access to amazing literary resources, opportunities to participate in professional/career development programming, etc.

Professional goals – you may wish to outline what you plan to do after you complete the program as a way of underscoring the importance of your choice to pursue graduate study.
(technical experience, personal experience):
Share any extracurricular opportunities you have had that show leadership, ability to work with a diverse group of people, teaching skills, etc.
Research degree applicants should identify specific faculty members whose research interests align with your own interests. 
Important Things to Remember
Details
Pay attention and follow instructions very carefully – every program is different and some have specific items/topics they want you to address.
Unless otherwise noted, this is an academically focused essay, not necessarily a personal essay. You will likely add some personal details here and there, but be sure to keep the focus on your academic background and future potential.
Proofread and pay close attention to details – they really matter!
Have others from a variety of perspectives read your essay before you submit it – they should be looking at it in terms of content, style, and grammar. Remember, those outside of your field can provide you with valuable perspective and feedback.
Keep in mind that you can continue editing your ASOP after you have submitted it to programs with earlier deadlines.
Length, Format and Tone
Unless otherwise noted one to two pages in a standard font and size is typical.
Include your full name and proposed program of study at the top of each page – if faculty are not reading an electronic version of your essay, pages can become separated.
Write with confidence and in an active voice – doing this makes your sentences clear and less wordy/complicated.
Language should be positive and focused. Since faculty are the ones reviewing your application, it is fine to use discipline-specific terminology, tone, and style in your ASOP.
Final Checklist
Have you…
Described your academic background in enough detail to show your experience and preparedness in the field?
Shown that you are a good fit for the program you are applying to?
Defined why you want a graduate degree in this field?
Demonstrated that you are self-motivated, persistent, competent, and have the skills necessary to be successful in graduate school?
Followed the ASOP instructions as defined by the program you are applying to?
Polished, proofread, and had others review your ASOP?
