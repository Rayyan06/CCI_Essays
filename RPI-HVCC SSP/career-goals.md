After graduating from HVCC, I plan to transfer to into RPI's ECSE department and pursue the co-terminal BS/MS pathway with a focus in control Systems and Embedded Hardware.
In the near-term, I aim to secure internships or co-ops in the semiconductor ecosystem, especially in automation and controls for manufacturing equipment, test/measurement, or reliability, migrating to real hardware under real constraints, leveraging the programs connections to partners like NYCreates, IBM, and GlobalFoundries to gain hands-on experience in a Fab environment. Long term, I seek to become an R&D Engineer designing high-reliability control systems for advanced manufacturing or large-scale scientific facilities. Whether in a semiconductor fab or a national lab, I want to real-time, safety and perfomance-critical systems where hardware meets firmware.
