I am interested in the Semiconductor Scholars Program because it sits at the exact intersection of my technical obsession and my academic trajectory. I have always been driven by the convergence of physical dynamics and digital logic. This drive led me to design a custom 4-axis CNC machine and build a scratch-made Optical Encoder, where I wrote low-level AVR-C firmware to process high-speed signals. While these projects taught me how to integrate hardware and software, they also revealed a limitation: I was working with off-the-shelf microcontrollers. I want to go deeper—down to the silicon that makes these controls possible.

The future of control systems—whether for particle accelerators or autonomous robotics—relies on specialized semiconductors like high-performance FPGAs and ASICs. I am applying to this program to bridge the gap between my current discrete-component prototyping and the nanofabrication technologies that define modern engineering.

Furthermore, RPI is already my destination. I have consulted with the Transfer Director to map out my path into RPI’s Co-Terminal BS/MS program in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE). This scholarship would provide not just financial support, but crucial access to RPI faculty and laboratories before I even transfer. The opportunity to engage in summer research and connect with industry partners would allow me to accelerate my understanding of semiconductor manufacturing and design. I see this program as the essential catalyst to transform from a student who uses chips into an engineer who designs them, contributing to the revitalization of the US semiconductor industry.
