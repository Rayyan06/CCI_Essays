I am a builder who thinks in systems. From my foam-cutting CNC to modeling stock markets, I crave the intersection of physical dynamics and algorithmic logic. I need a university that doesn't just teach Engineering; I need one that emphasizes Systems.

RPI’s ECSE department is unique because of its explicit focus on Systems Engineering. I am eager to take ECSE 4440 (Control Systems) and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time Applications) (use the course numbers you found!). These aren't just classes to me; they are the theoretical toolkit I need to refine the intuitive understanding of dynamics I developed self-studying calculus.

I am applying with a specific trajectory in mind. I have already consulted with the Transfer Director regarding the Co-Terminal BS/MS program. My goal is to earn both degrees to prepare for a PhD and a career at a National Lab. I have structured my community college transfer credits specifically to fit this accelerated timeline.

I am looking for a peer group that matches my intensity. I want to join The Forge to prototype my next embedded systems projects and contribute to the Embedded Hardware Club. I see myself contributing to research at the Center for Automation Technologies and Systems (CATS), bridging the gap between my hobbyist robotics and industrial-scale automation.

RPI is the only place where my obsession with "how things work" meets the rigor required to make them work better.
