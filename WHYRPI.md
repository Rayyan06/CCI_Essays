Attending HackRPI 2025 was the deciding factor. Working in your labs, I experienced the intense, collaborative culture that defines RPI. I am specifically applying to pursue the Co-Terminal BS/MS program in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE). My goal is to specialize in Control Systems, and RPI offers the rigorous upper-level coursework, like Real-Time Applications, that I need to transition from building hobbyist robots to designing industrial instrumentation. I want to be where theory meets application, and my experience on campus proved RPI is that place.
