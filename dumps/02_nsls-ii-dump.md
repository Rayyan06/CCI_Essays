NSLS-II DUMP

Stands for: National Synchrotron Light Source

Used for research and chemistry, physics, life sciences, bio, mat science, quant mat stuff. Don't need to know too much of this because its not what i'm honing for, the engineering angle of things.

Creates light beams 10 billion times brighter than the sun.

29 beamlines! high throughput robot driven sample processing.
capacity for 30 additional beamlines, 4 new already under dev, definitely gonna take note of this

bluesky software suit.e. Hmm maybe i'll look at this

THE MACHINE
By circulating electrons in a beam, half a male long, at nearly the speed of light, for 5000 hours a year. no interruptinos. 
NSLS-II ACCELERATOR DIVISION
their the mechanics of the science machines
they want to increase brightness 100 fold!
100 FOLD??? OMG
90 Kev electron beam, accelerateed before entering storage ring

a quick thought on units, electron-volts? that's an odd unit. I recall it from physics lab tho. Been a while. KeV is WIld though.

booster to storage ring transport line connects the booster synchrotron to the storage ring

more RF cavities! Yippee! a connection between my fermilab part and this part
interesting stuff ngl
restore energy loss after electrons have created bright beams of light during their journey

ohhh so the electrons wiggle and create light! How quaint LOL

The stripline is an RF device that enables ORBIT FEEDBACK
DID I HEAR FEEDBACK??
CONTROL SYSTEMS OMGGGGG LETS GO!
KEEPS it stable at high current
the undulators inside the storage ring are one source of NSLS-II x ray beams.

the frontends are devices that connect the sources of x-yrays, undulators, with  beamlines. 

Beamlines are experimental stations that are used... for science! Ok my job probably stops here, unless... i want to work on beamlineS! should i mention it?? IDK, maybe. I'm more excited about the feedback stuff. maybe tho. 

In summary
Electron gun, LINAC(another one!), a booster ring, and storage ring,
First three are needed to prepare the electron kiddies on their journey around the storage ring.
Electron gun? BAMBAMBAM LOL

hold a stable position, demns, and angle to below 10% of its size

intensity has a variabliity threshhold of less than 5%

Aight lets talk about beamlines then

66m-72m long. Wow. Mad stuff
Extra long beamlines too, 200m long.
equipeed with a photon source that generates the light beams=

photon sources span from 0.1eV to 300 keV
Using a combination of bending magnets, three pole wigglers (LMAO), insertaion device sources, blah blah blah i don't get it

Storage ring, this is the real deal
2598 feet circum. Damn. 
30 magnet arrays

talks about details of their distrubution of the beamlines

accelerator tunnel - heart of nsls-ii
x rays produced using electronics, accelerate them in linear accelerator, near speed of light
synchotron ring, spin around in circular orbit, different color magnets for different purposes, when they spin they produce x ray light, come out at beam lines where experiments are done

COOL STUFF
