RTSQ: READ THE STUPID QUESTION
So, what's the stupid question here?
Professional Goals
Describe your long-term academic and professional goals, and how participation in the CCI program could develop or expand skills required to achieve those goals.

VERBS: Describe, develop, expand, achieve
NOUNS: goals, CCI program, skills
ADJECTIVES: Long-term - (over long timescales), academic - relating to my studies ~30% of the essay, professional - relating to my career ~30% of the essay, skills required ~30% of my essay, 

So the essay is essentially two parts
my long term goals, and then how the CCI program develops/expands skills required to achieve them

hmm that's not too hard.
What are my long term academic goals?
let's dump:
1. finish my associates - duh, but thats not long term
2. finish my bachelors - transfer, so thats getting long term
3. Get my BS+MS, cool, thats longer term too
4. Get PhD, long term
5. Do research- very vague ngl,
6. Teach??? idkkkkk lmao 
7. Focus area: Control systems and electronics

long term professional goals
1. Work on really cool complex control system machines
2. Work on embedded hardware
3. Be part of BIG engineering projects
4. darn this is tough

Questions to ask yourself before you start writing?
1. What is unique about my background?
my homeschooled background, my gap year? my loss of direction(already mentioned in pe essay), hm. ok
2. When did I become interested in this field?
-> When I started doing electronics, programming, and math.
-> Yeah this is tough to remember. 
-> Oh, ok. So i recall i loved programming at first, i wanted to major in CS actually, but then I also loved doing circuits, radioshack kit whatnot making arduino weather stations, so thats where it came from
-> Hmmmmm Why electrical? idk, its a blend of both! Cool
3. What specific experiences (including work) have furthered this interest? 
a) the 2 Axis CNC machine project
b) the encoder project
c) My engineering design class projects
d) My IEEE project(but this is recent so idk)
e) my radioshack tinkering + arduino stuff
f) my engineering club work?
g) idkkkkkk

What are my career goals? answered above
What personal characteristics, skills, will enhance my prospects for success in this field? Idk if this is a more techincal experience quostion ,but i'll give it a sho
-> My organization! 
-> My homeschooled creative deep background
-> My deep programming skills & problem Solving skills
-> My teamwork! Ahaha
-> My time! I have so much free time when I'm not doing coursework
-> My dedication! The number of projects! My hands-on love!

Response pattern:
1. State your goals and where they came from
1.1 Academic Goals
1.2 Professional Goals

2. Transition to the skills I have(develop) and need (expand) to succeed in the field

. Remember smooth prose. 

1. My goals came from my experience:
a) Didn't want to become a CS major because I LOVED hands on robots and machines
b) Didn't want to become a MechE because I STILL WANTED TO DO PROGRAMMING and I LOVED CIRCUITS
c) I didn't even know about EE at firs,t but EE i found out in 2024 is a field, so i targeted it. Yes, i only found out in 2024.
d) Control systems suits me best in EE

My long-term professional goal is to become a Lead R&D Engineer designing complex control systems for large-scale scientific instrumentation at a National Lab. My path to discovering what I loved was a winding road of confusion and discovery, rather, it was a process of elimination? (idk if i should frame it this way)

Or, it was not straight? Idk
Initially, I thought I wanted to go into programming because I loved the hard logic(idk why ngl). I loved the creativity it allowed you to do. However, I found out I missed tinkering wiht physical things. Conversely, when I worked on purely mechanical projects, I missed the logic and complexity of code. Thats why I chose electrical, and within it, control systems. It perfectly connects the physical reality (dynamic systems) to the mathematical and logic theory (the porgarmming). I realized that my passion lay here.

Currently, I am finishing my foundational engineering coursework, including Differential Equations, Circuits, and Dynamics. Next Fall, I transfer to RPI. I'm deliberately taking mechanical courses such as Thermo, Statics, Dynamics as well to build a broad understanding of the physical systems I intend to control..I have already consulted with the Transfer Director regarding their Co-Terminal BS+MS program that will allow me to earn both degrees in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE) on an accelerated timeline. I am specifically targeting courses such as ECSE 4440 (Control Systems) and ECSE 4760 (Real-Time Applications) (idk about this sentence). Ultimately, I plan to pursue a PhD to contribute to the forefront of research in the field.

However, I recognize the missing piece to take my development to the next level: scale. While I have developed skills in C++ and embedded circuits through personal projects, I lack exposure to the big scale technologies not available at my CC( leave this out?). The CCI program will expand my technical toolkit from the hobbyist microcontroller level to the professional high-perfoormance FPGAs and ASICs. I need to devolop the ability to work on multidisciplinary archietechtures that are unavailable...


In short, participating in the CCI program is the essential bridge between my current and goals. Itwill allow me to test my skills on a multidiscilpanry team....
