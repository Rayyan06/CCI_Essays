My primary choice is **Fermilab**, specifically within the Instrumentation and Controls Departments. My decision was solidified during a conversation with Aisha Ibrahim, the Department Head for Instrumentation. She discussed the critical role of Beam Position Monitors (BPM's) and the instrumentation needed to run them. Ms. Ibrahim introduced me to FPGA design and . I read that Fermilab is erI want to apply my knowledge of C++ and Embedded systems to these complex projects. I want to learn FPGA design since it closely translates with my love of circuits! I understand that Interns typically have a steep learning curve to understand the codebase and hardware, but I'm prepared to apply my relevant technical skills to accelerate the transition! I found my love of designing instruments through my personal projects, such as my Encoder Project where I had to carefully tune the position of two PhotoInterrupts to align with slots in my custom-printed disk. I gained an appreciation of the challenges of data acquisition through trying to manage the serial port and building an interface that takes that data and displays it on the screen fast enough in LabVIEW. At FermiLab, I am specifically drawn to the Instrumentation and Controls departments. I'm passionate about the precision required for high precision instrumentation.

# My Second Choice

My second choice is **Brookhaven**. I'm interested in the various projects relating to instrumentation and controls. During a virtual career fair I attended, I learnt that Brookhaven, like FermiLab, has accelerator science and technology going on there and many other sensors. I would love to work on this. I'm specifically interested in the NSLS-II and the Accelerator Test Facility, as they specifically relate to my interest in Beams. Additionally, since I am based in Upstate New York and am transferring to RPI(Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), BNL is the closest National Lab for me and will enable me to build a network.
