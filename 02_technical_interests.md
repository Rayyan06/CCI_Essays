My first choice is Fermilab because it demands what I most want to learn: high-speed, hardware-level control systems. Propelling particles to 84% the speed of light using PIP-II's Superconducting LINAC is the scale of engineering that I'm preparing for.

My Optical Encoder project—capturing edge transitions at high speed with interrupt-driven firmware—sparked my interest in Data Acquisition. I realized that Beam Diagnostics requires this skill set, but at a scale where latency is critical. While my encoder sampled at kilohertz, beam position monitors operate at megahertz, requiring instant feedback beyond what standard microcontrollers can achieve.

To better understand the department, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, Head of Instrumentation. She described her department's critical role: just as doctors need instruments to treat patients, her team builds the diagnostic tools physicists use to observe particles, like Beam Position Monitors and readout electronics. She noted that my background in C++ and robotics makes me a versatile candidate for the Controls Department as well. I aim to work at that intersection.

Fascinated by this discussion, I researched PIP-II's Machine Protection System. I learned how superconducting RF cavities enable high-intensity Continuous Wave operation, but require rapid interlocks to prevent cryomodule damage. My goal is to learn FPGA-based control logic by contributing to the MPS, helping ensure the <10µs response time required to inhibit the beam, protecting the infrastructure that will power DUNE's neutrino research.

My second choice is Brookhaven National Lab, specifically the NSLS-II. While Fermilab focuses on rapid fault detection, BNL centers on sub-micron orbit precision. I want to understand how RFBPMs integrate with Stripline Feedback Kickers to correct orbit deviations in real time, maintaining position stability below 10% of beam size.

Two specific projects align with my interests. First, the Accelerator Tunnel Surveillance Robot. Its fusion of visible, IR, and radiation sensors for real-time diagnostics connects to my sensor and PID experience. Second, the RF group's recent work on coldbox redundancy, developing PLC software with 80+ control loops to manage cryogenic systems is exactly the sort of controls challenges I want to tackle.

Whether debugging a feedback loop, adjusting cryogenic controls, or building an autonomous robot, I'm ready to apply my embedded systems skills at NSLS-II.
