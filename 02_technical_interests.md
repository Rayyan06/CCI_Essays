My first choice is Fermilab because it offers the ultimate challenge in my area of interest: high-speed, hardware-level control systems. I am fascinated by the engineering required to propel particles to 84% the speed of light using the new PIP-II Superconducting LINAC.

I first became excited about capturing physical data at minute timescales during my personal Optical Encoder project. Writing custom C++ Interrupt Service Routines to capture high-frequency photointerrupt data, and optimizing USART serial communication to visualize it live in LabVIEW, hooked me on the difficulty of precise signal timing. I realized that high-energy physics experiments requires this Data Acquisition skill set, but at a scale where microsecond latency determines their success.

To understand the work, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, the Department Head for Instrumentation. She noted that my background in C++, Robotics, and Data Acquisition makes me a versatile candidate for the Controls Department as well. The intersection is exactly where I aim to work. Following our discussion, I researched the PIP-II project further and learned how the shift from the copper to superconducting RF cavities introduces massive high frequency engineering complexity. I am specifically eager to work on FPGA-based systems like the RF protection interlock (RFPI) to optimize these systems. I want to apply my embedded systems skills to these industrial scale timing challlenges, and I'm prepared to navigate the steep learning curve of the laboratory's codebase to help build the electronics that drive advances in neutrino science.

My second choice is Brookhaven National Lab, specifically for the NSLS-II. While Fermilab focuses on the high energy of particle collision, my interest in BNL stems from the challenge of precision stability. I want to understand the feedback control loops required to keep an electron beam stable within microscale tolerances.

Additionally, I am intrigued by the high-throughput robotic sample processing at the NSLS-II beamlines. In IEEE club, I'm building a self-balancing robot to gain practical exposure to PID control and motion stability. I want to apply this embedded systems experience to optimize scientific automation. Furthermore, since I'm transferring to RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), establishing a research connection with BNL— the premier National Lab in the Northeast—is a strategic step for my future career.
