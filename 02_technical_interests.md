# My First Choice

My first choice for my host laboratory is **FermiLab**. I was guided to this decision after setting up a meeting with Aisha Ibrahim, the Department Head for Instrumentation. Our discussion regarding the technical projects she works on in the department piqued my interest in applying. During it, she explained that at FermiLab, the Engineers design the instruments that the physicists use to conduct measurements. I was especially interested in the Beam Position Monitors and automated data acquisition. I want to apply my knowledge of C++ and Embedded systems to these complex projects. I want to learn FPGA design since it closely translates with my love of circuits! I understand that Interns typically have a steep learning curve to understand the codebase and hardware, but I'm prepared to apply my relevant technical skills to accelerate the transition! I found my love of designing instruments through my personal projects, such as my Encoder Project where I had to carefully tune the position of two PhotoInterrupts to align with slots in my custom-printed disk. I gained an appreciation of the challenges of data acquisition through trying to manage the serial port and building an interface that takes that data and displays it on the screen fast enough in LabVIEW. At FermiLab, I am specifically drawn to the Instrumentation and Controls departments. I'm passionate to the precision required for high precision instrumentation.

# My Second Choice

My second choice is **Brookhaven**. I'm interested in the various projects over there relating to instrumentation and controls. During a virtual career fair I attended, I learnt that Brookhaven, like FermiLab, has accelerator science and technology going on there and many other sensors. I would love to work on this. For example, the NSLS-II, RHIC, Accelerator Test Facility, Tandem Van De Graff, Space Radiation laboratory. Additionally, since I am based in Upstate New York and am transferring to RPI( Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute), BNL is the closest National Lab for me and will enable me to build a network.
