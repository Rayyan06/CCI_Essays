My first choice is Fermilab because it offers what I most want to learn: microsecond-scale embedded control systems that protect PIP-II's superconducting LINAC as it accelerates particles to 84% light speed.
My interest in data acquisition was sparked by my optical encoder project. Writing C++ firmware to capture high-speed position data forced me to squeeze efficiency out of every clock cycle in my interrupt logic, as I was collecting data faster than it could be transmitted to serial. I struggled to manage timing constraints and buffer overflows, which made me wonder: how does Fermilab handle data orders of magnitude faster? I realized that while my encoder sampled at kHz, PIP-II's Beam Diagnostics operates at MHz, feeding data to FPGAs instead of standard microcontrollers for near-instant feedback.
To better understand the task, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, Head of Instrumentation. She highlighted her team's role in building the diagnostic tools physicists use to observe particles. She pointed out that my C++ and robotics background fits the Controls Department. This led me to research their work further, where I became fascinated by PIP-II's Machine Protection System.
My goal is to learn how FPGA logic protects PIP-II's superconducting cryomodules within the sub-10µs response time essential for Continuous Wave operation. Since PIP-II is deploying EPICS from scratch, I want to apply my C++ experience to integrate instrumentation directly into the control system by developing IOC drivers.
My second choice is Brookhaven's NSLS-II. While my focus at Fermilab is protection during acceleration, I also want to learn how NSLS-II maintains a perfectly stable electron beam.
My self-balancing robot introduced me to the basic concepts of closed-loop control: measure tilt, compute correction, drive motors. NSLS-II's Fast Orbit Feedback does this at 10kHz. BPMs measure beam position and angle, cell controllers compute corrector strengths, and magnets respond, all within microseconds. I'm keen to understand the optimizations involved in shaving hardware and firmware latency, while keeping stability below 10% of beam size.
Additionally, just as PIP-II's rapid interlocks inhibit the beam to protect cryomodules, I'm interested in NSLS-II's active interlocks that protect the vacuum chamber and dump the beam within milliseconds if it strays outside its limits.
Whatever the system, I'll read the datasheets, trace the signals, debug the loops, and ask questions until I understand.
