My first choice is Fermilab because it demands what I most want to learn: real-time embedded control systems which operate on microsecond scales where high-level software cannot keep up. Propelling particles to 84% the speed of light using PIP-II's Superconducting LINAC is the scale of engineering I'm preparing for.

My optical encoder project, capturing edge transitions at high speed with interrupt-driven firmware, sparked my interest in Data Acquisition. I realized that Beam Diagnostics requires this skill set, but at a scale where latency is critical. While my encoder sampled at kHz, beam position monitors operate at MHz, requiring instant feedback beyond what standard microcontrollers can achieve.

To better understand the department, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, Head of Instrumentation. She described her department's critical role: just as doctors need instruments to treat patients, her team builds the diagnostic tools physicists use to observe particles, like Beam Position Monitors and readout electronics. She noted that my background in C++ and robotics makes me a versatile candidate for the Controls Department as well. Since PIP-II will deploy EPICS from scratch, I also look forward to contributing IOCs to the new controls infrastructure.

Fascinated by this discussion, I researched PIP-II's Machine Protection System. I learned how superconducting RF cavities enable high-intensity Continuous Wave operation, but require rapid interlocks to prevent cryomodule damage. My goal is to learn FPGA-based control logic by contributing to the MPS, helping ensure the <10µs response time required to inhibit the beam, protecting the infrastructure which will power DUNE's neutrino research.

My second choice is Brookhaven's NSLS-II. While Fermilab focuses on rapid fault detection, BNL centers on sub-micron orbit precision. I want to understand how RFBPMs integrate with the stripline feedback kickers to correct orbit deviations in real time, maintaining position stability below 10% of the beam size.

Two specific projects caught my eye. First, the Accelerator Tunnel Surveillance Robot and its fusion of visible, IR, and radiation sensors for real-time diagnostics connects to my sensor and PID experience. Second, the RF group's recent work on coldbox redundancy, developing PLC software with 80+ PI control loops to manage cryogenic systems, is exactly the kind of challenge I'd love to tackle.

Whatever the system, I'm ready to peruse the datasheets until it clicks.
