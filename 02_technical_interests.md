My first choice is Fermilab because it offers what I most want to learn: microsecond-scale embedded control systems that protect PIP-II's superconducting LINAC as it accelerates particles to 84% light speed.
My interest in data acquisition was sparked by my optical encoder project. Writing C++ firmware to capture high-speed position data forced me to optimize serial communication buffers and interrupt detection logic when collecting data faster than it could be transmitted. At Fermilab, I realized that Beam Diagnostics faces this same challenge, but at a massive scale. While my encoder sampled at kHz, PIP-II's beam position monitors operate at MHz, requiring FPGAs instead of standard microcontrollers.
To better understand the work, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, Head of Instrumentation. She highlighted her team's role in building the diagnostic tools physicists use to observe particles. She noted that my C++ and robotics background made me a strong candidate for the Controls Department. Her suggestion led me to research further, and I became fascinated by PIP-II's Machine Protection System.
My goal is to learn how FPGA logic protects PIP-II's superconducting cryomodules with the sub-10µs response time essential for Continuous Wave operation. Since PIP-II is deploying EPICS from scratch, I'm eager to learn both the hardware and software layers and use my C++ experience to contribute to the IOCs that make up the control system.
My second choice is Brookhaven's NSLS-II. While my focus at Fermilab is protection during acceleration, I also want to learn how NSLS-II maintains a perfectly stable electron beam.
My self-balancing robot taught me the challenges of closed-loop control: measure tilt, compute correction, drive motors. NSLS-II's Fast Orbit Feedback does this at 10kHz. BPMs measure beam position and angle, cell controllers compute corrector strengths, and magnets respond, all within microseconds. I'm keen to understand the optimizations involved in shaving hardware and firmware latency, while keeping stability below 10% of beam size.
Just as PIP-II's rapid interlocks inhibit the beam to protect the cryomodules, NSLS-II's active interlocks protect the vacuum chamber, dumping the beam within milliseconds if it strays outside safe limits.
Whatever the system, I'll read the datasheets, trace the signals, debug the loops, and ask questions until I understand..
