My first choice is Fermilab because it offers the ultimate challenge in my area of interest: high-speed, hardware-level control systems. I'm fascinated by the engineering required to propel particles to 84% the speed of light using the new PIP-II Superconducting LINAC.

My Optical Encoder project—capturing edge transitions at high speed with interrupt-driven firmware—sparked my interest in Data Acquisition. I realized that Beam Diagnostics requires this skill set, but at a scale where microsecond latency determines success. My encoder sampled at kilohertz, but beam position monitors operate at megahertz, requiring hardware-level optimization beyond what microcontrollers can achieve.

To better understand the department, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, the Head for Instrumentation. She described her department's critical role: just as doctors need instruments to treat patients, her team builds the instruments physicists use to observe the bean, like Beam Position Monitors and readout electronics. She noted that my background in C++ and robotics makes me a versatile candidate for the Controls Department as well. I aim to work at that intersection. 

I researched PIP-II further, learning how superconducting RF cavities enables high-intensity Continuous Wave operation, but require protection systems to prevent cryomodule damage. My goal is to learn FPGA-based control logic by contributing to the Machine Protection System, implementing RF interlocks that ensure the 10µs response time required to inhibit the beam.

My second choice is Brookhaven National Lab, specifically the NSLS-II. While Fermilab focuses me on rapid fault detection, BNL centers on precise orbit correction. I'm fascinated by how RFBPMs integrate with Stripline Feedback Kickers to correct sub-micron orbit deviations in real time.

Two other projects caught my attention. I read on how the RF group's recent added coldbox redundancy, developing PLC software with 80+ control loops to manage cryogenic systems mirrors the controls work I want to learn. I'm also drawn to the Accelerator Tunnel Surveillance Robot. Its fusion of visible, IR, and radiation sensors for real-time diagnostics connects to my sensor & PID experience. 

Whether contributing to beam feedback systems, cryogenic controls, or improving autonomous diagnostics, I'm ready to apply my embedded systems skills at NSLS-II.
