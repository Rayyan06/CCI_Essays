My primary choice is Fermilab. My interest was cemented during a conversation with Aisha Ibrahim, the Department Head for Instrumentation. She discussed the departments role of designing the instruments for the accelerator, namely the Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) and the electronics that process their signals. Ms. Ibrahim noted that my background in C++ and robotics would also make me a strong fit for the Controls Department.

This suggestion aligns perfectly with my interests, as my passion rests on the intersection between Hardware and Software. I am specifically eager to work on FPGA-based systems for the PIP-II project, like the RFPI or high-speed data acquisition. I want to apply the skills I developed during my Optical Encoder project, where I wrote custom C++ ISR's to capture position data and designed a LabVIEW interface to visualize it. I understand that the learning curve at Fermilab is steep, especially getting up to the codebase, but I'm prepared to apply these technical skills to contribute to the laboratory's mission.

My second choice is Brookhaven National Lab. Specifically, I'm interested in the Instrumentation Division and the NSLS-II device. Like the PIP-II at Fermilab, at the NSLS-II, I'm drawn to the engineering challenges required to maintain the facility's highly stable electron beam, which aligns with my interest in feedback control loops and stability.

Additionally, I was excited to learn about the high-throughput robot-driven sample processing capabilities at NSLS-II. I want to apply my background in C++ and Robotics to help optimize these automated systems, or contribute to the software development efforts that power these experimental control systems. Whether working on Instrumentation or automation, I believe BNL offers to perfect environment to apply my embedded systems skills. Since I am transferring to RPI(Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) in 2026, establishing a connection with BNL is a strategic step forward in my professional network.
