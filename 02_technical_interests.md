(how should i structure this? first choice second choice or intro to the common interests and then go to first choice?). idk.My first choice is Fermilab because it offers the ultimate challenge in my area of interest: high-speed, hardware-level control systems. I am fascinated by the engineering required to propel particles to 84% the speed of light using the new PIP-II superconducting LINAC.

I first became excited about capturing physical data at minute timescales during my personal Optical Quadrature Encoder project. Writing custom C++ Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) to capture high-frequency photointerrupt data, and optimizing USART serial communication to visualize it live in LabVIEW, hooked me on the difficulty of precise signal timing. I realized that high-energy physics requires this exact skill set, but at a scale where microsecond latency determines the success of the experiment.

To understand the work, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, the Department Head for Instrumentation and talked about FPGA programming at Fermilab. She noted that my background in C++, Robotics, and Data Acquisition places me at the intersection of the Instrumentation and Controls departments. (idk being at the intersection of departments sounds non-commital. Hm. But i want to be as broad as possible as well. Like thats what theey said in the guide to applying, don't limit yourself to one department. Just gotta figure out how to communicate that. I didn't emphasize my interest in DAQ enough when talking to Aisha Ibrahim and so she thought i was purely a Control systems robotics guy. I don't want the instrumentation dept to feel this. Hmm). This is exactly where I want to be. Following our conversation, I researched the PIP-II project further and learned how the shift from the copper in the old LINAC to Superconducting RF cavities introduces massive high frequency engineering complexity. I am specifically eager to work on FPGA-based systems like the RF protection interlock (RFPI) to manage these risks. I want to apply my embedded systems skills to these industrial scale timing challlenges, navigating the steep learning curve of the laboratory's codebase to help build the electronics that drive the next generation of neutrino science.

My second choice is Brookhaven National Lab, specifically for the NSLS-II. While Fermilab focuses on the high energy of particel collision, my interest in BNL stems from the challenge of stability. I want to understand the feedback control loops required to keep an electron beam stable within sub-micron tolerances.

Additionally, I am intrigued by the high-throughput robotic sample processing at NSLS-II. In my IEEE club, I'm building self-balancing robot to give me practical exposure to PID control and motion stability. Whether working on stability instrumentation or . Furthermore, since I'm transferring to RPI (Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute), establishing a research connection with BNL, the premier National Lab in the Northeast is a strategic step for my future career.
