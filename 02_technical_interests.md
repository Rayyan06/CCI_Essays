My first choice is Fermilab because it offers the ultimate challenge in my area of interest: high-speed, hardware-level control systems. I'm fascinated by the engineering required to propel particles to 84% the speed of light using the new PIP-II Superconducting LINAC.

I became excited about capturing physical data at minute timescales during my personal Optical Encoder project. Writing C++ Interrupt Service Routines to capture high-frequency photointerrupt data and optimizing USART serial communication with buffers, visualizing it live in LabVIEW hooked me on the challenges of Data Acquisition. I realized that Beam Diagnostics requires this skillset, but at a scale where microsecond latency determines success.

To better understand the department, I reached out to Aisha Ibrahim, the Head for Instrumentation. She detailed her department's critical role in designing the "eyes" of the accelerator, specifically the Beam Position Monitors and readout electronics. She noted that my background in C++ and Robotics interest makes me a versatile candidate for the Controls Department as well. The intersection is where I aim to work. I researched the PIP-II project further, learning how the shift from copper to superconducting RF cavities enables high-intensity Continuous Wave operation, but requires protection systems to prevent cryomodule damage. I am specifically eager to develop firmware logic for the Machine Protection System (MPS), implementing the FPGA-based controls and RF interlocks that ensure the 10µs response time required to inhibit the beam. I'm prepared to navigate the laboratory's codebase and contribute to building the electronics that drive advances in neutrino science.

My second choice is Brookhaven National Lab, specifically the NSLS-II. While my focus at Fermilab is rapid fault detection, my interest at BNL centers on precise orbit correction. I was fascinated by the in-house development of RFBPMs and want to understand how these sensors integrate with Stripline Feedback Kickers to correct sub-micron orbit deviations in real time.

Additionally, I'm eager to contribute to the Accelerator Tunnel Surveillance Robot. My project background in sensor fusion, PID control, and electromechanical design provides a strong foundation to enhance its autonomous operation. Finally, since I'm transferring to RPI, establishing a connection with the premier National Lab in the Northeast aligns with my long-term goals.
