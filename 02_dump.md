Structure:
I was first exposed to data acquisition during my encoder project, now i want to extend that to control systems?

Questions:
1. elaborate WHY i want to participate in the CCI program
2. Which labs are you interested in conducting research, and how your interest align with those labs
3. What do you hope to gain from the experience
4. What particular factors idnfluneced your choice of host labs! (yes, deffo gotta talk about that!)

Mention Self balancing robot project?

PIP-II details:
1. Megawatt particle accelerator
2. Accelerates particles in continouus or pulsed mode
3. Linear particle accelerator
4. create and propel high energy particle mbeams
5. 84% of the speed of light
6. starts with a bottle of hydrogen gas, enough particles to run for a few motnhs
7. uses electric fields to propel accelerate partciles to high energy
8. only properls electriclaly charged particles
9. Filament turns nuetrally charged molecules in hydrogen gas to charged
10. Uses oscillating electronic fields to "surf" particles, when tuned JUST right
11. different stages like different gears, optimized for increasing speeds of particle
12. each stage requires its own unique structure and  radio frequency to produce right em waves
13. First stage: RFQ, by berkely , 162.5 Mhz, intricate pattern of peaks and valleys, only 4.5 meters, propels like 2.1 million volts
14. series of magnets focuses beam , bhabha atomic research center, 100 magnets
15. Next, superconducting section, longest section! Cool! Niobium cavity, -271C, propel better than copper, nearly no heat. cryomodules, liquid helium. Argonne national lab made first cryomodule. 162.5Mhz
16. Superconducting acceleration, 325 Mhz, secondstage. (so each stage is a frequency), 9 cryomodules. like the race car engine of it, up to 54% speed of light, 177 million volts
17. final and lognest: 13 cryomodules, less than 1 millionth of a second. Even higher RF , 650 Mhz, elliptical shape, 800 million volt energy, up to 84% speed of light
18. niobium cavities can reach gradients 40 million v/m. Pip_II will be the new heart of FNAL.
19. Most powerful nuetrino beam.

DUNE
1. Neutronos interact VERY little with normal matter. 
2. Nuetrinos actually change their identity in a cyclical pattern called oscilaltion or sthg
3. With neutronos, energy is not the name of the game, number of neutronos /second matter.
4. for every 100 billion neutronis that hit detector, only one interacts
5. beam of neutrones: accelerate proton beam and smash them
6. FNAL accelerator actually 4 very diff accelerotars, each at diff speeds
a) LOW ENERGY ACCELERATOR (pre acc)
b) LINEAR ACC (LINAC) medium energy
c) High energy accelerator (booster)
d) very high energy (main injector)

LINAC WAS LIMITING, not surprising, very old. never designed to perform in 2020s 
no way to make small mods to LINAC. Needed to be replaced. PIP-II. PIP-I earlier effort. 
PIP-II ENTIRELY REPLACES OLD LINAC to new one, gonna replace teh pre accelerator too
HOW will PIP-II Lineac be better
strong electric fields are used to push elec charged particles to accelerator
RF waves are beamed into cavities, amking extremely storng electric fileds
RF cavities. Fields have to oscillate. 
origanl metal in LINAC, but RF waves induced e-currents in walls  that caused it to heat up.
Spoon in microwave lol.
All that energy that goes up to heating up the metal doesn't accelerate the beam. Heat up too much - melts, becomes useless
Turn on and off the radio waves to give time to cool off, not the best way
PIP-II - SUperconductors, no resistance, don't heat up, all the RF waves go into accelerating
You can leave them all on the time and contastly send beams through
But we won't send beams constantly.
PIP-II double the energy of existing linac, 800 million EV instead of 400
how is pip-II better?
PIP-II can accelerate ~200x more protons/s than LINAC
how many protons are available to do research
current: 0.7 MW of proton power, PIP-II 1.2 MW.
Limitations in booster accelerator come underway. 
When Booster is upgraded, 2.4MW will be possible. Most intense beam of neutronoes.
How tho? FNAL experts are crazy good.Very technically challenge. We scientists love technically challenging projects! Other groups are collabing from around the world.
Some of the replacement RF cavitties . PIP-II 5 distinct cavities (stages). Like a gear in the car.  

(note, this was an old video). I need latest data. but ya
tech in pip-ii applies to industry

detectors - liquid argon, interac,t shower of particles and light. Info analyzed.

Latest updates: PIP-II coldbox arrived in fermilab this january
october: PIP-II collab recieved authorization for use and possession of high-bay building, part of in-progress Linac complex.
this will alllow the collab to begin snstalling accelerator components and support equipment, using componens

The project received DOE CD-2 approval in Dec 2020, CD-3a approval
in March 2021 and CD-3 approval in April 2022. Construction of the
cryogenic plant building was completed in December 2022 and work
began on the Linac Complex in January 2023. Successful beam tests
were completed in PIP2IT in April 2020 and validated performance of the
first two PIP-II cryomodules. A prototype of the high-beta 650 megahertz
cryomodule was completed and underwent a successful cooldown
in spring 2023. The PIP-II project will enable physics by the late 2020s.
I have a little exposure to charged particles in physics class! during the lab experiment where we did that eletron ring experiment! the charge differential and everything! so maybe ya. Aw should've asked him for a letter of recommendation!! DARNIT.
