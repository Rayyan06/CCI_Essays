Structure:
I was first exposed to data acquisition during my encoder project, now i want to extend that to control systems?

Questions:
1. elaborate WHY i want to participate in the CCI program
2. Which labs are you interested in conducting research, and how your interest align with those labs
3. What do you hope to gain from the experience
4. What particular factors idnfluneced your choice of host labs! (yes, deffo gotta talk about that!)

Mention Self balancing robot project?

PIP-II details:
1. Megawatt particle accelerator
2. Accelerates particles in continouus or pulsed mode
3. Linear particle accelerator
4. create and propel high energy particle mbeams
5. 84% of the speed of light
6. starts with a bottle of hydrogen gas, enough particles to run for a few motnhs
7. uses electric fields to propel accelerate partciles to high energy
8. only properls electriclaly charged particles
9. Filament turns nuetrally charged molecules in hydrogen gas to charged
10. Uses oscillating electronic fields to "surf" particles, when tuned JUST right
11. different stages like different gears, optimized for increasing speeds of particle
12. each stage requires its own unique structure and  radio frequency to produce right em waves
13. First stage: RFQ, by berkely , 162.5 Mhz, intricate pattern of peaks and valleys, only 4.5 meters, propels like 2.1 million volts
14. series of magnets focuses beam , bhabha atomic research center, 100 magnets
15. Next, superconducting section, longest section! Cool! Niobium cavity, -271C, propel better than copper, nearly no heat. cryomodules, liquid helium. Argonne national lab made first cryomodule. 162.5Mhz
16. Superconducting acceleration, 325 Mhz, secondstage. (so each stage is a frequency), 9 cryomodules. like the race car engine of it, up to 54% speed of light, 177 million volts
17. final and lognest: 13 cryomodules, less than 1 millionth of a second. Even higher RF , 650 Mhz, elliptical shape, 800 million volt energy, up to 84% speed of light
18. niobium cavities can reach gradients 40 million v/m. Pip_II will be the new heart of FNAL.
19. Most powerful nuetrino beam.

DUNE
1. Neutronos interact VERY little with normal matter. 
2. Nuetrinos actually change their identity in a cyclical pattern called oscilaltion or sthg
3. With neutronos, energy is not the name of the game, number of neutronos /second matter.
4. for every 100 billion neutronis that hit detector, only one interacts
5. beam of neutrones: accelerate proton beam and smash them
6. FNAL accelerator actually 4 very diff accelerotars, each at diff speeds
a) LOW ENERGY ACCELERATOR (pre acc)
b) LINEAR ACC (LINAC) medium energy
c) High energy accelerator (booster)
d) very high energy (main injector)

LINAC WAS LIMITING, not surprising, very old. never designed to perform in 2020s 
no way to make small mods to LINAC. Needed to be replaced. PIP-II. PIP-I earlier effort. 
PIP-II ENTIRELY REPLACES OLD LINAC to new one, gonna replace teh pre accelerator too
HOW will PIP-II Lineac be better
strong electric fields are used to push elec charged particles to accelerator
RF waves are beamed into cavities, amking extremely storng electric fileds
RF cavities. Fields have to oscillate. 
origanl metal in LINAC, but RF waves induced e-currents in walls  that caused it to heat up.
Spoon in microwave lol.
All that energy that goes up to heating up the metal doesn't accelerate the beam. Heat up too much - melts, becomes useless
Turn on and off the radio waves to give time to cool off, not the best way
PIP-II - SUperconductors, no resistance, don't heat up, all the RF waves go into accelerating
You can leave them all on the time and contastly send beams through
But we won't send beams constantly.
PIP-II double the energy of existing linac, 800 million EV instead of 400
how is pip-II better?
PIP-II can accelerate ~200x more protons/s than LINAC
how many protons are available to do research
current: 0.7 MW of proton power, PIP-II 1.2 MW.
Limitations in booster accelerator come underway. 
When Booster is upgraded, 2.4MW will be possible. Most intense beam of neutronoes.
How tho? FNAL experts are crazy good.Very technically challenge. We scientists love technically challenging projects! Other groups are collabing from around the world.
Some of the replacement RF cavitties . PIP-II 5 distinct cavities (stages). Like a gear in the car.  

(note, this was an old video). I need latest data. but ya
tech in pip-ii applies to industry

detectors - liquid argon, interac,t shower of particles and light. Info analyzed.

Latest updates: PIP-II coldbox arrived in fermilab this january
october: PIP-II collab recieved authorization for use and possession of high-bay building, part of in-progress Linac complex.
this will alllow the collab to begin snstalling accelerator components and support equipment, using componens

The project received DOE CD-2 approval in Dec 2020, CD-3a approval
in March 2021 and CD-3 approval in April 2022. Construction of the
cryogenic plant building was completed in December 2022 and work
began on the Linac Complex in January 2023. Successful beam tests
were completed in PIP2IT in April 2020 and validated performance of the
first two PIP-II cryomodules. A prototype of the high-beta 650 megahertz
cryomodule was completed and underwent a successful cooldown
in spring 2023. The PIP-II project will enable physics by the late 2020s.
I have a little exposure to charged particles in physics class! during the lab experiment where we did that eletron ring experiment! the charge differential and everything! so maybe ya. Aw should've asked him for a letter of recommendation!! DARNIT.


NSLS-II data dump

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is one of the most advanced synchrotron light sources in the world. The facility enables scientists from academia and industry to tackle the most important challenges in quantum materials, energy storage and conversion, condensed matter and materials physics, chemistry, life sciences, and more by offering extremely bright light, ranging from infrared light to x-rays.

To create its intense ultrabright light, NSLS-II has an advanced particle accelerator complex that spins electrons around its half-mile-long ring at nearly the speed of light. NSLS-II’s accelerators are comprised of many complex engineering systems. Running this intense, stable electron beam for 5000 hours every year, with no interruptions, requires constant attention to every integral component.

The NSLS-II Accelerator Division focuses on securing safe and reliable machine operations while maintaining top performance. Their expertise ensures the best experimental conditions for all visiting researchers.

The Accelerator Division has built the accelerator complex, a project that lasted from 2005 to 2014. Since completion, the group operates it and continues to strive for improved performance. Furthermore, accelerator physicists and engineers from NSLS-II are planning for the future by assessing various upgrade options to increase the brightness 100-fold and enable even more exciting science in the next decade.

placeholderThe stripline is an RF device that enables orbit feedback to keep the electron beam stable at its high current.
placeholderThe undulators inside the storage ring are one source of NSLS-II’s bright x-ray beams. The electron beam passes between long arrays of magnets and creates x-rays at every turn.
placeholderThe frontends are devices that connect the sources of x-rays, undulators, with the experimental stations or beamlines. Intense x-ray beams stream through this vacuum line towards the sample and the detector.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) accelerator complex encompasses everything from the creation of the electrons to the generation of brilliant synchrotron light. The NSLS-II accelerator complex consists of an electron gun, a linear accelerator, a booster ring, and the storage ring. The first three sections are needed to prepare the electrons for their journey through the storage ring, while the medium-energy electron storage ring contains all of the devices that produce the bright light beams.

To create the best experimental conditions for the visiting researchers using NSLS-II's brilliant light, the electron beam can hold a stable position, dimensions, and angle below 10% of its size. Additionally, the intensity has a variability threshold of less than 5%. .

Beamlines
The experimental hall that houses the storage ring offers enough space for up to 60 beamlines, a combination of light transport lines, and experimental stations. These beamlines can be 66 meters (m) to 72 m - or 216 feet to 236 feet - long. NSLS-II can also house nine extra-long beamlines, which can extend beyond the current building, with experimental stations located in an adjacent building. These beamlines can be about 200 m (656 feet) long. More details about NSLS-II beamlines and their capabilities can be found in the beamline directory or on the five Synchrotron Techniques & Methods pages.

Each beamline is equipped with a photon source that generates the bright light beams. Photons are the particles that all light is made of. These sources offer high average spectral brightness with high flux density. Brightness is a measure of how many photons of a certain type or wavelength, are produced, while flux density describes the number of photons produced in short time frame.

About the Accelerator Division
The NSLS-II Accelerator Division is dedicated to keeping electrons circulating in the machine. Their expertise ensures the best experimental conditions for all visiting researchers. The Division, builders of the accelerator complex, monitors consistent operation and works towards upgrades for ever better performance.

Photon Sources
The NSLS-II photon sources span a wide spectral range, from the far infrared (down to 0.1 eV) to the very hard x-ray region (>300 keV). This is achieved by a combination of bending magnets, three-pole wigglers, and insertion device sources, which generate the ultrabright light. Insertion device and bending magnet parameters (PDF).

Storage Ring
The NSLS-II storage ring has a circumference of 792 m (2598 feet). The arrangement of magnets that guide the electrons through the ring and straight sections, that can be used to install the insertion devices, is called a storage ring lattice. The NSLS-II storage ring lattice consists of 30 magnet arrays, or double-bend achromat (DBA) cells, that will accommodate about 60 beamlines. These beamlines can be distributed by type in the following way:

15 low-beta insertion device straights for undulators or superconducting wigglers
12 high-beta insertion device straights for either undulators or damping wigglers
31 bending magnet ports providing broadband sources covering photon energies from infrared to soft x-rays. Any of these ports can, alternatively, be replaced by a three-pole wiggler port covering the hard x-ray range
4 bending magnet ports on large gap (90 mm) dipoles for very far infrared light
Multiple insertion devices can be installed in a single straight section for additional beamline capacity.
