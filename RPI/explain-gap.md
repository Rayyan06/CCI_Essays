After completing my GED in November 2023, I experienced a gap year in 2024. Being homeschooled, I lacked the institutional guidance that directs most students into college. This autonomy was a double-edged sword; It allowed me to explore my interest deeply and gain true proficiency, but it also insulated me from the academic pathways.

I spent that time developing a business idea while working at my father's firm on projects such as an optical encoder and a foam cutting CNC. Eager to progress, I also began self-studying online courses like Circuits, Statics, and Calculus. I was dedicated, yet unaware of the opportunities I was missing: labs, clubs, mentorship, research, and internships.

By late 2024, I realized my independent path was limiting my academic potential. I researched engineering programs, only to find out I had missed every deadline. Undeterred, at the start of 2025 I enrolled in the Engineering Science program at HVCC, determined to catch up.

Though the gap set back my educational timeline, it provided essential direction. My projects allowed to explore my interests with depth and breadth. Originally drawn to Computer Science, I discovered that true passion lies in electrical engineering, a field that I hadn't even considered. I left my comfort zone in 2025, entering college with clarity and a determination, taking on every opportunity with energy and earning a 4.0 Major GPA. Now, I'm ready to channel this momentum into the rigorous curriculum at RPI.
