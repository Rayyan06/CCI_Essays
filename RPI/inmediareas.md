Manufacturing was building the Turtle Robot before Analysis had the specs, 3 weeks in, 3 to go. I called an emergency meeting and wrote requirements on the whiteboard, recalling the professor's warning: "Where are your numbers coming from?" We stopped guessing and left with concrete and testable constraints.

Leadership didn't come naturally. Homeschooled, I was used to working alone until my first group project, where I earned 0% on the reflection for writing that I'd "basically done all the work."

For this project, I pivoted. Placed on Management, I shifted focus from hardware to the system. I gathered sub-team input, consolidated a spec sheet, ran an FMEA (20+ failure modes), and pushed our test from Nov 17 to Dec 3 to ensure integration. The result? We passed 9/9 validation criteria, including 0.7kg load, 30° climb, and 30m range.

I realized that while skills can be solitary, systems are social. I bring to RPI the grit of the wolf who learned to hunt with the pack.
