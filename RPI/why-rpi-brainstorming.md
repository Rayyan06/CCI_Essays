What to Include in a Why Us College Essay
Try to draw strong connections between your interests and the opportunities at the college. When you read about academic programs, extracurricular activities, or unique opportunities at the college, what make you think, “Hey, if I were there I could…” Which opportunities excited you and what ideas did they spark?

Make a list of 10-15 reasons you would like to attend the college.

What are you looking forward to as a prospective student? 0. It's close by. yes, its the closest college to my house, barely 13 mins. Lol yes.

1. The rigorous coursework. Looking forward to advancing my knowledge.
2. The laboratories, though I have yet to identify particular ones at this stage. Maybe the Autonomy, Robotics, and Control (ARC) research area??? ya
3. The makerspaces, like MercerXLab and The Forge.
4. The networking and internship opportunities with industry and research partners; the career opportunities
5. The clubs and competitions, relating to technical and non-technical activities (e.g. hiking)
6. Co-Terminal BS/MS program

What aspects of your future academic department intrigue you?

1. I'm intrigued by the labs, for sure. I need to look into one of them I think
2. Are there any particular classes you hope to take? Why those courses?
3. Practically every class in Electrical Engineering ECSE intrigues me. But maybe, if I had to name some:
   a) ECSE 2410 - Signals and Systems
   b) ECSE 4440 - Control Systems Engineering
   Application of linear feedback theory to the design of large-scale, integrated control systems. Derivation of complex mathematical models of physical systems. Synthesis of appropriate control laws to provide stability. Simulation of complex control systems on digital computers.
   c) ECSE 2610 - Cptr Components & Oper (this looks really cool ,logic gates and all that)
   d) ECSE 2941 - Undergraduate Research Project
   e) ECSE 4090 - Mechatronics
   The synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, electronics, control engineering, and computer science in the design process. The key areas of mechatronics studied in depth are control sensors and actuators, interfacing sensors and actuators to a microcomputer, discrete controller design, and real-time programming for control using the C programming language. The unifying theme for this heavily laboratory-based course is the integration of the key areas into a successful mechatronic design.
   f) Robotics I
   A survey of the fundamental issues necessary for the design, analysis, control, and implementation of robotic systems. The mathematical description of robot manipulators in terms of kinematics and dynamics. Hardware components of a typical robot arm. Path following, control, and sensing. Examples of several currently available manipulators.
   g) ECSE 4760 - Real-Time Applications in Control and Communications
   Gosh, they're all so cool... But if I had to pick a couple, maybe like Mechatronics, Control Systems, Robotics? Idk. The immediate ones I'll take in Fall 2026 are also fascinating.
   What clubs or teams interest you?
   Embedded Club
   Outing Club
   Rensselaer Formula Hybrid
   Rensselaer Rocket Society
   RPI Drone Club
   RPI Fishing Club
   RPI Robotics Club
   Ambassadors
   The Forge
   Weightlifting

Are there particular outreach or networking programs that have caught your eye?

- The ambassadors
- The student Chapters like IEEE
  If you could choose between several colleges, why would you choose this school over other colleges?
- The Rigor for sure
- The hardcore STEM
- The engineering culture here over the SUNY schools that are more general
- The reputation and industry connections
