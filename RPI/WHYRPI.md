As a local junior transfer, I've reached my ceiling and need RPI's specialized Control Systems ECSE specialization. I'm looking forward to taking specialized upper-level courses in the field such as Control Systems and Mechatronics. I'm targeting the Co-Terminal BS/MS program to prepare for R&D roles. At HVCC, I was involved in clubs and activites, I plan to continue that at RPI. HackRPI 2025 confirmed my fit, I enjoyed those intense 24 hours and touring the campus the Mercer XlLb and the Forge. I'm looking for rigorous theory at RPI.
