I am taking ECSE to specialize in control systems, because I have exhausted pathways at my CC. I'm looking forward to taking specialized upper-level courses in the field such as ECSE 4440, ECSE 4090, to advance my knowledge in Electrical Engineering.  I'm targeting the Co-Terminal BS/MS program. At HVCC, I was involved in clubs and activites, I plan to continue that at RPI. At HackRPI, I was immersed in the culture, and during those 24 hours as I toured the campus and used the labs, it felt like my place.
