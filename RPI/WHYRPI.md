I'm targeting R&D work in control systems at a National Lab. As a junior transfer from HVCC, I need ECSE 4440 (Control Systems) and ECSE 4090 (Mechatronics) to graduate from breadboard contraptions to mission-critical hardware. The Co-Terminal BS/MS is my trajectory. At HackRPI, I collaborated with students to transform concepts into demos within 24 hours, troubleshooting circuits in Mercer XLab, coding in DCC rooms, and navigating its maze-like corridors to prototype in The Forge. As HVCC's IEEE lead and Makerspace VP, I'll bring my specs-first, test-and-iterate approach to the Embedded Hardware Club and continue teaching kids as an Engineering Ambassador.
