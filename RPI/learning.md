What did I really learn from my time at HVCC so far, my engineering design course more specifically, in general, in 2025? That I can apply to writing my story/background essay.

2025:
1. I learned the value of structured work, before I didn't have structure when I was learning things, now I do. While not having structure was great for digging deep into topics I loved, the structure allows for complete and thorough understanding in a different way, allowing me to cover more topics quicker by not meandering.
2. I learned how to work in teams; This was a big change for me, as all my projects prior had been solitary pursuits. This anngle could work for the essay too, tbh
3. I learned to teach others, this is a bit of a weaker angle since i don't have a tutoring position at my school, but now that I'm teaching kids, maybe. But nah, idk
4. I learned how to manage time. This actually could work for the essay, since I took on progressively heavier loads (8->12->18 credits) while balancing EC's and clubs. 
5. I seized opportunities, this could be a good angle too

1. The sentence/thought i had when i saw manufacturing building early? honest:
a) Good for them, they are making progress while the rest of the teams are lagging, they'll hold us forward... oh wait, but what if we need to justify the design, what if we are facing a problem, where's the documentation, how are they making decisions? All lost to the void!
2. What I wrote/said that got me the 0% reflection: 
a) I said I did basically ALL the work for the project. 
b) I said I should have disembursed work to them more, and regretted not "giving them" more work, nad that they didn't do enough . I forgot what else
3. The one thing i wrote on the board that shifted the team? When I started writing down what really we can measure or what affects our turtle robot
4. The moment I knew the new approach worked? When we were on the same page executing from a sheet of paper ( the spec sheet and risk analysis) instead of thin air. 


I'd also like to add to the essay something aobut systems and structuer, you know ,all the systems we use in teams like TRL, FMEA Waterfalls, checkins, whiteboard sessions, emails emails emails, meetings meetings meetings, managament, standup meetings and org charts, roles and heircharchy, talk about WHY they matter and what i learned about them.
