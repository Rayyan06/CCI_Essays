At the start of 2025, I was stuck. Homeschooled K-12, I mastered Calculus and Programming on my own, yet lacked a clear roadmap. After earning my GED in 2023, I spent 2024 working on scattered projects at my father's engineering firm. He viewed college as unnecessary, insisting I could learn online while starting a business. I followed this route until my grandmother warned that I was limiting my potential without the structure of formal education. While I initially doubted her, it was evident my progress had stagnated. Clueless about applications, I scrambled but missed every deadline. Undeterred, I enrolled in a late-start chemistry course at community college and mapped out an ambitious 1.5-year Engineering Science degree plan.
College was a revelation. The ecosystem of professors, labs, and peers was a resource I hadn't even realized I was missing. I tackled coursework intensely, taking on a grueling summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. Far from buckling under tight deadlines, I excelled, crushing the curve on exams. I had spent the past year running from the very structure I needed. By fall, I was fully committed, registering for a full 18 credits of engineering coursework. I seized every opportunity, joining the IEEE Club, getting elected as VP of the Engineering Club, and competing in HackRPI 2025, where I attended workshops and worked in RPI labs.
However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Unfamiliar with group work, I grew frustrated with my team's pace in my first design project. I took over all the work to ensure we met specifications. I remained oblivious to my attitude until a reflection exam, during which I bluntly dismissed their involvement. To my shock, I received a 0% grade on the question. When I asked why, the professor's message was clear: in the real world, prioritizing your own output over your team's input is a failure.
The Turtle Mover project tested this lesson. When the Manufacturing sub-team began building before Analysis had defined specs, I remembered the professor's warning: "Where are your numbers coming from?" Instead of fixing it myself, I called an emergency meeting, going up to the whiteboard and collectively brainstorming to define system requirements. This time, we aligned before the problem escalated and advanced as a team.
Looking back, while I can solve calculus problems at my desk, I cannot build complex systems alone. I've outgrown solitary learning, and I'm ready to bring this drive to a National Lab.
