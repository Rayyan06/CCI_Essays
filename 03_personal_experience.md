At the start of 2025, my future felt like a mountain peak obscured with fog. I had always loved Engineering from a young age, possessing a natural aptitude and drive to learn, but I didn't know where I wanted to apply this. Having been homeschooled K-12, I was a self learner at heart; and I had taught myself Calculus, Programming, and prototyping on my own. However, while I had a lot of fun doing practical projects at my father's engineering firm, I realized that hacking together an education from scattered online resources was inefficient. I lacked a roadmap of how to move forward. It was my grandmother who finally pierced the haze, insisting that my potential was dissolving without the structure of higher education. Initially skeptical, I researched Engineering Programs only to find that I had already missed the application dates. Undeterred, I enrolled in a late-start general chemistry course, and resolved to complete my Associates' degree in less than 1.5 years.

Stepping into a college chemistry lab for the first time was a huge shock. After years of reading textbook diagrams and kitchen-scale experiments, seeing professional laboratory equipment amazed me. In that moment, I resolved to use every resource available. Attacking my coursework with incredible energy, I enrolled in a heavy workload for the Compressed Summer Session, Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. 

By Fall 2025, I was fully committed. I registered for 18 credits of engineering coursework, in order to follow my plan. I seized every oppurtunity, getting elected Vice President of the Engineering Club, volunteering for STEM outreach, and competing in HackRPI 2025!

My shift from a solitary environment to a team based one wasn't all smooth sailing. During my first-ever design project(a Mug warmer), I struggled to work with my team, as it was my first ever group project. Perceived lack of effort from my team led me to perform nearly all the work myself to ensure we met specifications. To my shock, I received a 75% on the project - not for the engineering, but for my failure to collaborate. When I asked the Professor for feedback, he explained that engineering projects aren't just about raw output, but about working with teams.

Later in the semester, during the "Turtle Mover" project, I changed my approach. I applied these lessons and facilitated communications to manage the team, ensuring every member participated. Today, the fog has vanished, I have finished this semester with stellar grades, but more importantly, I learned that intelligence with collaboration is a superpower, and I'm ready to bring this energy into the CCI program.
