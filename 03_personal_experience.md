At the start of 2025, I was stuck. Homeschooled K-12, I was a self-directed learner, studying Calculus and Programming on my own, yet I lacked a clear roadmap. After earning my GED in 2023, I spent 2024 working on scattered projects at my father's engineering firm. He viewed college as unnecessary, insisting I could hack together an education online while starting a business. I followed this route until my grandmother intervened, warning that I was limiting my potential without a formal degree. While I initially doubted her advice, it was evident that my progress had stagnated. Clueless about applications, I scrambled but missed every deadline. Undeterred, I found an Engineering Science program at the local community college, enrolled in a late-start Chemistry course, and mapped out an ambitious 1.5-year degree plan.

Stepping into college was a revelation. The ecosystem of professors, labs, and peers was a resource I hadn't even realized I was missing. I tackled my coursework with intensity, taking on a grueling summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. Far from buckling under tight deadlines, I excelled, crushing the curve on exams. I had spent the past year running from the very structure I needed.

By fall, I was fully committed, registering for 18 credits of engineering coursework. I seized every opportunity, joining the IEEE Club, getting elected VP of the Engineering Club, and competing in HackRPI 2025.

However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Unfamiliar with group work, I grew frustrated with my team's pace in my first Design Project. I took over all the work to ensure we met specifications. In doing so, I had quietly thrown my teammates under the bus. I remained oblivious to my attitude until a reflection exam, where I bluntly dismissed their involvement. To my shock, I received a 0% grade on the question. When I asked why, the professor's message was clear: In the real world, prioritizing your own output over the team's input is a failure.

The Turtle Mover project tested this lesson. When manufacturing began building without specs, I called an emergency meeting, led a whiteboard session, and helped the team define requirements together. The project only moved forward when we collaborated, not when each sub-team remained siloed.

Looking back, while I can solve calculus problems at my desk, I cannot build complex systems alone. I've outgrown solitary learning, and I'm ready to bring this drive to a National Lab.
