At the start of 2025, I was a lone wolf lost in fog. Homeschooled K-12, I was a self-directed learner, obsessively teaching myself Calculus and Programming, but I lacked a clear roadmap. While I watched my peers advance, I stuck to scattered projects at my father's engineering firm. My father's approach was that college was unnecessary, insisting that I could hack together an education online. I believed him until my grandmother finally intervened. She gave me a tough reality check, that my potential was dissolving without the rigor of higher education. I scrambled to find an engineering program, only to find out I had already missed every deadline. Undeterred, I found an Engineering Science program at my local community college, enrolled in a late-start Chemistry course, and planned to finish in less than 1.5 years.

Stepping into a chemistry lab was a visceral shock. After years of DIY experiments, I was dumbfounded by the instruments. I hadn't realized what I was missing. In that moment, I decided I would exploit every resource available. I attacked my coursework with ferocity, taking on a punishing summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. Determined to prove myself, I didn't just pass; I dominated the curve, proving that my work ethic was my strongest asset.

By Fall 2025, I was fully committed, registering for 18 credits of engineering coursework. I seized every opportunity, joining the IEEE Club, getting elected VP of the Engineering Club and competing in HackRPI 2025.

However, my transition from lone wolf to team player had bumps along the way. In my first Engineering Design Project, group work was an alien experience. Perceiving my team members' slower pace as lack of effort, I became frustrated and took over the project, doing all the work to ensure we met specifications. I thought I had succeeded until the projects exam. To my shock, the professor gave me a 0% grade on the collaboration question. When I asked why, he taught me that in a, being the 'hero' who does everything is actually a failure to lead.

I took that lesson to heart immediately. During my next "Turtle Mover" project, I adopted the role of Facilitator. I applied my systematic thinking to the team, mapping out specifications and clearing communication blockers. I've learned that even a lone wolf can learn to thrive in the pack. Intelligence is potential, but synergy is kinetic energy. Today, I'm ready to bring that energy to a National Lab.
