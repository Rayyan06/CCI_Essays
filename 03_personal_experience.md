At the start of 2025, I was trapped in a vacuum. Homeschooled K-12, I was a self-directed learner, mastering Calculus and Programming on my own, yet I lacked a clear roadmap. After earning my GED in 2023, I spent 2024 working on scattered projects at my father's engineering firm. He viewed college as unnecessary, insisting I could hack together an education online while starting a business. I followed this route until my grandmother intervened, warning that I was limiting my potential without a formal degree. While I initially doubted her advice, I realized my progress had stagnated. Clueless about applications, I scrambled but missed every deadline. Undeterred, I found an Engineering Science program at my local community college, enrolled in a late-start Chemistry course, and mapped out an ambitious 1.5 year degree pathway to satisfy prerequisites.

Stepping into college was a revelation. The ecosystem of professors, labs, and peers was a resource I hadn't even realized I was missing. I resolved to maximize every resource at my disposal. I tackled my coursework with intensity, taking on a grueling summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. Far from buckling under tight deadlines, I excelled, crushing the curve on exams. I realized that I had spent the past year running from the very structure I needed.

By fall, I was fully committed, registering for 18 credits of engineering coursework. I seized every opportunity, joining the IEEE Club, getting elected VP of the Engineering Club, and competing in HackRPI 2025.

However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Unfamiliar with group work, I grew frustrated with my team's pace in my first Design Project. I took over all the work to ensure we met specifications. In doing so, I had quietly thrown my teammates under the bus. I remained blind to this error until a reflection exam, where I bluntly dismissed them in writing. To my shock, I received a 0% grade on the question. When I asked why, the professor's message was clear: In the real world, prioritizing your own output over the team's input is a failure.

Later in the semester, during the Turtle Mover project, I applied this feedback and changed my approach. Instead of isolating our team, I focused on communication, mapping out specifications and ensuring every sub-team owned their element. Looking back at 2025, I realized that while I can solve calculus problems alone, I cannot build complex systems at my desk. I have outgrown the vacuum of solitary learning, and I'm ready to bring this drive to a National Lab.
