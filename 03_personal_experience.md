At the start of 2025, I was stuck. Homeschooled K-12, I mastered Calculus and Programming on my own, yet lacked a clear roadmap. After earning my GED in 2023, I spent 2024 working on scattered projects at my father's engineering firm. He viewed college as unnecessary, insisting I could learn online while starting a business. I followed this route until my grandmother warned I was limiting my potential without the structure of formal education. While I initially doubted her, it was evident that my progress had stagnated. Clueless about applications, I scrambled but missed every deadline. Undeterred, I enrolled in a late-start Chemistry course at the local community college and mapped out an ambitious 1.5-year Engineering Science degree plan.

College was a revelation. The ecosystem of professors, labs, and peers was a resource I hadn't even realized I was missing. I tackled coursework intensely, taking on a grueling summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. Far from buckling under tight deadlines, I excelled, crushing the curve on exams. I had spent the past year running from the very structure I needed. By fall, I was fully committed, registering for 18 credits of engineering coursework. I seized every opportunity, joining the IEEE Club, getting elected VP of the Engineering Club, and competing in HackRPI 2025.

However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Unfamiliar with group work, I grew frustrated with my team's pace in my first Design Project. I took over all the work to ensure we met specifications, quietly throwing my teammates under the bus. I remained oblivious to my attitude until a reflection exam, where I bluntly dismissed their involvement. To my shock, I received a 0% grade on the question. When I asked why, the professor's message was clear: In the real world, prioritizing your own output over the team's input is a failure.

The Turtle Mover project tested this lesson. When Manufacturing began building without specs, I remembered the professor's warning: "Where are your numbers coming from?" I called an emergency meeting, going up to the whiteboard and collectively brainstorming to define requirements together. This time, the win came from collaboration, showing that progress requires alignment and communication.

Looking back, while I can solve calculus problems at my desk, I cannot build complex systems alone. I've outgrown solitary learning, and I'm ready to bring this drive to a National Lab.
