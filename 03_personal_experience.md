At the start of 2025, I was operating in a vacuum. Homeschooled K-12, I was a self-directed learner, obsessively teaching myself Calculus and Programming, but I lacked a clear roadmap. After earning my GED in late 2023, I spent 2024 working on scattered projects at my father's engineering firm. He viewed college as unnecessary, insisting that I could learn (or hack together) online while starting a business. I believed him until my grandmother intervened, warning that I was limiting my potential without a formal degree. Though initially skeptical, I realized my progress had stagnated. I scrambled to apply, only to find I had missed every deadline. Undeterred, I found an Engineering Science program at my local community college, starting with a late-start chemistry course. I meticulously mapped out a pathway to finish in 1.5 years, taking Calculus 1 online to satisfy prerequisites in time.

Stepping into a college environment was a revelation. I was dumbfounded not just by the instruments, but by the ecosystem of professors, labs, and peers. I hadn't realized what I was missing. In that moment, I decided I would exploit every resource available. I attacked my coursework with ferocity, taking on a grueling summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2. Determined to prove myself, I didn't just pass; I dominated the curve. I had spent the past year running from the very structure I needed.

By Fall 2025, I was fully committed, registering for 18 credits of engineering coursework. I seized every opportunity, joining the IEEE Club, getting elected VP of the Engineering Club and competing in HackRPI 2025.

However, my transition from lone wolf to team player had bumps. In my first Engineering Design Project, group work felt foreign. Perceiving my team members' slower pace as lack of effort, I became frustrated and took over the project, doing all the work to ensure we met specifications. I remained blind to this error until a reflection exam, where I bluntly dismissed my teammates in writing, validating only my own output. To my shock, I received a 0% grade on the question. When I asked why, the professor's message was clear: In the real world, prioritizing your own output over the team's input is project failure.

I took that lesson to heart immediately. During class's next "Turtle Mover" project, I pivoted. Instead of dominating, I focused on integration, aligning the sub-teams and ensuring everyone had a part to play. The success of that project reshaped my mindset. Looking back at 2025, I've learned that even a lone wolf can learn to thrive in the pack. I realized that while I can solve calculus problems in a vacuum, complex engineering projects take teamwork. Today, I'm ready to bring that collaborative drive to a National Lab.
