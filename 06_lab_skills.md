Electronics and Instrumentation

Test Equipment: Proficient with oscilloscopes and multimeters for circuit analysis and debugging.
Circuit Prototyping: Extensive breadboarding for rapid testing, experienced with PCB layout and fabrication using KiCAD.
Microcontrollers: Interfaced sensors (I2C, SPI, UART) and actuators (stepper motors, servos) with AVR (ATmega) and Arduino hardware.
Soldering: Familiar with through-hole and basic SMD soldering techniques.

Fabrication and Mechanical

3D printing: Extensive experience with FDM printers (Creality, Prusa, BambuLab) and slicers (Cura, Prusaslicer, Bambu Studio). As VP of the Engineering Club & Makerspace, managed a fleet of 20+ 3D Printers, performing troubleshooting, bed-leveling, and regular maintenance.

CNC Machining: Designed and built a custom foam-cutting CNC machine; familiar with G-Code generation. Used wood-cutting CNC to fabricated catapult components.

Electromechanical Assembly: Built integrated systems (e.g. Optical Encoder, Foam Cutting CNC, RC Turtle-Rescue Robot, Mug Warmer) combining 3D printed parts, custom PCBs, firmware, and hand/machine tools.

General Laboratory
Physics 1 (Mechanics) and Physics 2 (E&M and Circuits): Data collection using photogates, force sensors, motion detectors. Circuit Analysis using oscilloscopes. Electron Beam Deflection Experiments with Helmholtz coils.
Chemistry: Titration, Spectrophotometry, Gravimetric Analysis, and Safe reagent handling.

Safety and Documentation: Familiar with PPE usage and laboratory safety standards. Wrote FMEA documentation for class projects and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for makerspace equipment. Worked with Electronics Datasheets for Sensors & Actuators, Analyzing Requirements and limitations.

Eager to apply these skills to accelerator-scale instrumentation, including vacuum systems, cryogenics, and beam diagnostics.
