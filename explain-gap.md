Following the completion of my GED in 2023, I experienced a one-year educational gap during 2024 before enrolling in community college at the start of 2025.

This interruption was intentional. As a homeschooled student who had self-taught Calculus and Programming, I was influenced by my father, an engineer who viewed formal college as unnecessary. He encouraged me to "hack" my education online while working at his firm and starting a business. I spent 2024 following this path, working on electromechanical prototyping and independent coding projects.

However, this period revealed the limitations of solitary learning. While I gained practical skills, my progress stagnated without the rigor of a structured curriculum. I realized that while I could build a robot, I lacked the theoretical depth to engineer one at scale. At my grandmother's urging, I re-evaluated my trajectory and recognized that skipping college was limiting my potential.

I ended this gap in January 2025 by enrolling in the Engineering Science program at my local community college. To compensate for the lost year, I adopted an accelerated pace, completing a heavy summer workload of Calculus 2, Physics 1, and Physics 2 simultaneously. This gap year ultimately served as a confirmation that I thrive in an academic environment, solidifying my resolve to pursue a formal degree at RPI.
