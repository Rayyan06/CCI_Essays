# Step 1: Brainstorming

Key terms that I identify with:
Architect, Builder, Collaborator, Experimenter, Facilitator, Improvisor, Planner, Problem Solver, Self-starter, Systems-Maker

Top 5:
Facilitator, Experimenter, Planner, Self Starter, Systems-Maker

3 Values I want to nurture: 
Scientist, Risk-taker, Champion

Facilitator - I played this role during the turtle mover project, where I helped facilitate progress in the project by clearing up communication between sub teams by opening up communication channels and removing blockers such as the lack of specs and direction

Experimenter - I played this role both in my personal & class projects, when I was making the DIY optical encoder and when I was making the mug warmer. 

Planner - This is another one, I love planning things in advance. I did this for the class projects and my other projects as well. I like to plan things out in my planner and make gantt charts for everything I do. I use Notion and breakdown every task into my database. 

Self-Starter - I take initiative. When my grandmother told me to pursue higher education, I took her words to heart and looked into college programs myself. When I

Systems-Maker - Ooh this is one of my favorites, and it draws in to almost everything I do. I make systems. Like when I couldn't find stuff, I used Gridfinity to organize it.  I make systems for everything. For exams, I follow a clear system of practicing to do them. I obsess in drawing graphs. For memorizing Qur'an, I created a detailed tracker.

# Questions to ask myself:
1. Have I faced significant challenges? 
Well, kind of. My father absolutely discouraged me from going to college, calling it a scam. No one ever told me what to do. I tried to learn engineering on my own. I was directionless while my peers were studying. So in a way? yes.
But, my life has been a piece of cake compared to others. I haven't had to work any job (but i was discouraged from working a job and coming out of the shell too, so not my fault), I haven't struggled in a major way (aside from being extremely lonely during covid & homeschooled but wasn't everyone?). So the word *significant* could be dropped here. But yes, challenges
2. Do I want to write about them? I don't know, maybe sure? it does give context. But more importantly I like to write about the story this year, I think its a cool story. I want to write about how I came from zero to hero. 

Narrative structure? Hmm iffy about this
Montage structure? maybe suits better
 
Narrative:
1. Challenges + Effects
2. What I did about them
3. What I learnt=

Actually, this could work. 

Montage:
1. Style that jumps around in time

Theme: lone wolf -> collaborator (i  think this is goshdarn perfect, love it.) cuz it summarizing my mentality change, from my father's "lone wolf" attitude, breaking free and attending college with people!!!! Big engineering projects take a lot of people!)
Outline:
I. Introduction
A. Hook
1. Directionless/Lost/Solitary metaphor? Show, don't tell? Not broad/generalized?
B. Background information
1. Where I was prior to 2025.
2. Talk about my love for tinkering, circuits, math, programming ,....
C. Thesis statement? Idk is this done for this essay?

II. Body
A. Paragraph 1: Coming into college? (or should i talk about my year in the office? would that fit better in the opening? idk)
1. Topic sentence
2. Supporting evidence and ideas
a) Reasns, facts, proof, hard stuff y'know (entering the chem lab, crushing it?)
b) Analyze what it meant
i) why did my experience really matter? (because I experienced what having tools and a teacher makes a big difference, and being surrounded by ppl (well, kinda, because it was just in the lab and out at the time, the people learning aspect probably fits better later during the fall semester maybe, or summer, idk. Cuz fall is when I really started interacting with people and clubs)

Summarize and transition=

B. Paragraph 2: My fall semester? But then, where do i put my "summer of hell"? maybe at the end of paragraph 1 as a transition
1. Topic Sentence
Support my experience coming into fall, meeting ppl, club, taking opportunities, ....
2. Supporting evidence: ENgineering design class expoerience, learning my "lesson" of working with a team. Should i talk about that 75%? maybe . OR maybe i can add to that and talk about the reverse engineering project where I did most of the work as well, and the turtle mover project idk.

Conclusion:
A. I've learned to work collaboratively in this year
B. I'm ready to work for Fermilab/BNL
