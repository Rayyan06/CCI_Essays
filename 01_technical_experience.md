From breadboard contraptions to a turtle-rescuing robot, my engineering experience has progressed from solo builds to complex team projects.
At my father's engineering firm, I built a custom 4-axis foam-cutting CNC with modular 3D-printed components. I chose linear rods over rails or V-wheels, balancing cost and simplicity, and added anti-backlash nuts on the lead screws for precise positioning.
For a catapult experiment requiring kinematic data, I developed a custom quadrature optical encoder when off-the-shelf options exceeded budget. I printed a 72-slot disk, designed the photointerrupter PCB, and created a snap-fit enclosure. The core challenge? Sampling every edge transition without missing data. To solve this, I rewrote the firmware in AVR-C, replacing polling with interrupts, adding state-machine logic, and overclocking the ATmega to maximize sample rate. A circular buffer handled USART serial output with checksummed byte packets to ensure integrity. On the PC, a LabVIEW producer-consumer loop processed incoming data in real-time, visualizing position and velocity on charts.
In college, I shifted to team projects where I applied theory and systematic processes. For my Mug Warmer, I ran thermal calculations in MATLAB to determine the minimum heating element power and insulation specifications. Initial testing revealed that cement resistors transferred heat ineffectively, so I incorporated my team's input and switched to nichrome wire. Our foam-insulated PETG enclosure was the only one in class to maintain water at 55±2°C for 3 hours!
Later, our class was divided into sub-teams to build an FPV-controlled turtle-rescuing robot with a motorized claw. As a leader on the management team, I defined specs and verified them through testing, our robot achieving 0.7kg lift, 30° climb, and 30m range. I conducted an FMEA analyzing 20+ failure modes, tracked progress using TRL milestones, and led weekly stand-up meetings to sync sub-teams.
The RPI Hackathon tested my ability to deliver under pressure. When my club teammates were unavailable, I partnered with a CS student to integrate computer vision libraries into a gesture-controlled video game in under 24 hours. Currently, I'm combining my skills in the IEEE Club's Self-Balancing Robot, where I'm writing PID control algorithms to interpret IMU input and drive the motors. As Engineering Club VP, I'll lead our team through the upcoming TYESA competition, sharpening skills I'm eager to bring to a national lab.
