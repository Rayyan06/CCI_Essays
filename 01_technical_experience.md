My engineering education began in reverse; I mastered fabrication before theory. As a homeschooled student, I bypassed standard pathways to study a broad range of interests. For example, I independently learned Python (Django) for web development and C++ for embedded systems. I applied my skills at my father's engineering firm, progressing from CAD modeling to designing complex electromechanical prototypes, including a Quadrature Optical Encoder and a 2-axis Foam Cutting CNC. This experience provided a hands-on foundation of hardware-software integration, yet it was largely solitary.

In my Engineering Design course, I faced the new challenge of working in a team. For the Mug Warmer Project, I engineered the heating plate circuit, insulating enclosure, and control electronics. After testing revealed that our initial ceramic resistor design lacked sufficient heat transfer, I pivoted to Nichrome wire, calculating the power dissipation required and implementing a thermostat circuit to achieve a thermal stability of 55±1°C.

Later, the class was tasked with building a remotely operated turtle rescue robot to save turtles from road traffic. I was placed on the Management Sub-Team. The project initially stalled due to a disconnect between Manufacturing and Analysis; Manufacturing had begun building a prototype before the specifications were written. Identifying this blocker, I called an emergency class meeting and went to the whiteboard, mapping out the project requirements. This intervention was a turning point in the project, propolling the team towards building a functional prototype. I played a key role by writing test and specification documents, maintaining the Gantt Chart, and developing the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to mitigate hardware risks.

The RPI Hackathon tested my ability to deliver under pressure. When my original teammates were unavailable, I partnered with a CS student I met onsite. Starting from scratch, we integrated computer vision libaries into our fullstack application to develop a video game controlled by real-time hand gestures in under 24 hours.

Currently, I am writing the PID sensor code for a Self Balancing Robot with the IEEE Club. As VP of the Engineering Club, I test my leadership skills by coordinating student teams for external eventns, including the recent Pumpkin Launch and the upcoming TYESA competition. I am ready to apply this mix of technical skills and team leadership at a National Lab.
