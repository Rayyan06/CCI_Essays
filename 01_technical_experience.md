Prior to formal education, my homeschooled background meant that I was always a self-directed learner. Whether building projects from my RadioShack Electronics Kit or self-teaching C++ and Calculus, I was driven by innate curiosity. I applied these skills at my father's engineering firm, where I had the independence to design complex prototypes, including an Quadrature Optical Encoder and Foam Cutting CNC.

In my Engineering Design course, I have consistently taken on leadership responsibilities within Design Teams. For the Mug Warmer Project, I operated with high independence, performing thermal calculations and ultimately selecting Nichrome wire over ceramic resistors to achieve a thermal stability of 55±1°C. Later in the semester, the entire class was divided into sub-teams and collectively tasked to make a "Turtle Mover" robot to save Turtles from getting crushed by cars while crossing the road, a common problem here in Upstate NY. I was placed on the Management team, responsible for tracking the project and facilitating communication between the sub-teams. The project started strong with the Manufacturing Team rapidly putting together a prototype, but we hit a critical hitch when the specifications were left undefined. Identifying the miscommunication, I went to the whiteboard and called an emergency meeting to align the class team. This effort refocused the team on defining the specs, and over the next few weeks, leading to a functional, spec compliant prototype. I played a major role in the management team, writing the test document and specification documents, maintaining the Gantt Chart, and developing the Failure modes and Risk analysis (FMEA) to mitigate design risks.

My technical agility was further tested at the RPI Hackathon. My original teammates were unavailable, so I quickly adapted by partnering with a lone RPI student I met in the auditorium. Despite not knowing him before, we rapidly prototyped a submission in 24 hrs, integrating computer vision libraries to develop a functional video game controlled by hand gestures.

Currently, I am working on PID control code for a Self Balancing Robot with the IEEE Club and serving as the VP of the HVCC Engineering Club. While my independence in learning is a core strength, this year has taught me how to channel that drive into a collaborative team effort, something that will directly apply to working at a National Lab.
