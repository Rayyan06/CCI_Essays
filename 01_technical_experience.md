TODO: Refactor this part to focus on my projects more. take from technical interests and personal experience. 

To me, math was never an abstract concept, it was simply the instruction manual for what I wanted to build. As a homechooled student, I leveraged the freedom to study alot of things and execute complex projects independently. 


For example, I independently learned Python (Django) for web development and C++ for embedded systems. 

At my father's engineering firm, I progressed from learning CAD modeling to designing complex electromechanical prototypes. 

including a Quadrature Optical Encoder and a 2-axis Foam Cutting CNC. 

In my Engineering Design course, I faced the new challenge of working in a team. For the Mug Warmer Project, I engineered the heating plate circuit, insulating enclosure, and control electronics. After testing revealed that our initial ceramic resistor design lacked sufficient heat transfer, I pivoted to Nichrome wire, calculating the power dissipation required and implementing a thermostat circuit to achieve a thermal stability of 55±1°C.

Later, the class was tasked with building an RC crawler robot to save turtles from road traffic. I was placed on the Management Sub-Team. The project initially stalled due to a disconnect between Manufacturing and Analysis; Manufacturing had begun building a prototype before the specifications were written. Identifying this blocker, I called an emergency class meeting and went to the whiteboard, mapping out the project requirements. This intervention was a turning point in the project, propelling the team towards building a functional prototype. I played a key role by writing test and specification documents, maintaining the Gantt Chart, and developing the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to mitigate hardware risks.

The RPI Hackathon tested my ability to deliver under pressure. When my original teammates were unavailable, I partnered with a CS student I met onsite. Starting from scratch, we integrated computer vision libraries to develop a video game controlled by real-time hand gestures in under 24 hours.

Currently, I am writing the control algorithms for a Self Balancing Robot with the IEEE Club. As VP of the Engineering Club, I hone my leadership skills by coordinating student teams for external events, including the recent Pumpkin Launch and the upcoming TYESA design competition. I'm ready to apply this mix of technical skills and team leadership at a National Lab.
