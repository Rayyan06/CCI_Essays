From breadboard contraptions to a turtle-rescuing robot, my engineering experience has grown from solo builds to complex team projects.

At my father's engineering firm, I built a custom 4-axis Foam Cutting CNC with modular 3D-printed components. I chose linear rods over rails or V-wheels, a tradeoff balancing cost, rigidity, and simplicity, adding anti-backlash nuts on the lead screws for precise positioning.

For a catapult experiment requiring kinematic data, I developed a custom Quadrature Optical Encoder when off-the-shelf options exceeded budget. I printed a 72-slot disk, designed the photointerrupter PCB, and created a snap-fit enclosure. The core challenge? Sampling every edge transition without missing data. Realizing I needed to level up, I rewrote the firmware in AVR-C, replacing polling with interrupts, adding state machine logic, and overclocking the ATmega to maximize sample rate. A circular buffer handled USART serial output with checksummed byte packets ensuring integrity. On the PC, a LabVIEW producer-consumer loop processed incoming data in real-time, visualizing position and velocity on charts.

In college, I shifted to team projects applying theory and systematic processes. For my Mug Warmer, I ran thermal calculations in MATLAB to determine the minimum heating element power and insulation specifications. Initial testing revealed ceramic resistors transferred heat inefficiently, so I incorporated my team's input to switch to nichrome wire. Our foam-insulated PETG enclosure was the only one in class to maintain water at 55±2°C for 3 hours!

Later, our class was divided into sub-teams to build an FPV-controlled turtle-rescuing robot with a motorized claw. On the management team, I defined specifications, conducted an FMEA analyzing 20+ failure modes, tracked progress using TRL milestones and Gantt charts, and led weekly stand-up meetings to sync sub-team progress.

The RPI Hackathon tested my ability to deliver under pressure. When my club teammates were unavailable, I partnered with a CS student to integrate computer vision libraries into a gesture-controlled video game in under 24 hours. Currently, I'm combining my skills in the IEEE Club's Self-Balancing Robot, where I'm writing the PID control algorithms to interpret IMU input and drive the motors. As Engineering Club VP, I'll lead our team next through the upcoming TYESA design competition, sharpening the skills that I'm eager to bring to a national lab team.
