My engineering education began in reverse, I mastered the fabrication before the theory. As a homeschooled student, I would bypass standard pathway to study a broad range of interests, for instance I independently mastered Python (Django) for web development and C++ for embedded systems. I applied my skills at my father's engineering firm, progressing from CAD modelling to designing complex electromechanical prototypes, including a Quadrature Optical Encoder and a 2-axis Foam Cutting CNC. This experience provided a hands-on foundation of hardware-software integration, yet it was a solitary pursuit.

In my Engineering Design course, I faced a new challenge of testing my ability to work in a team. For the Mug Warmer Project, I engineered the heating plate circuit, insulating enclosure, and control circuit. After testing revealed that our initial ceramic resistor desgin lacked sufficient heat transfer, I pivoted the design to Nichrome wire, calculating the power dissipation required and implementing a thermostat control circuit (control circuit twice?) to achieve a thermal stability of 55±1°C.

Later, the class was tasked with building a turtle rescue robot to save turtles from road traffic, a common problem in NY. I was placed on the Management Sub-Team. The project initially stalled due to a disconnect between the Manufacturing and Analysis sub-teams; Manufacturing had begun building a prototype before the specifications were written. Identifying this blocker, I called an emergency class meeting and went to the whiteboard, mapping out the project requirements. This intervention enabled the sub-teams to proceed, leading to a functional prototype. I played a major role in the management team, writing the test document and specification documents, maintaining the Gantt Chart, and developing the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to mitigate hardware risks.

My technical agility was tested at the RPI Hackathon. When my original teammates were unavailable, I partnered with a student I met onsite. Despite having no prior history, we rapidly prototyped a submission for presentation in 24 hours, integrating computer vision libraries to develop a video game controlled by real-time hand gestures.

Currently, I am implementing PID control loop for a Self Balancing Robot with the IEEE Club. Additionally, as VP of the Engineering Club, I organize technical workshops and coordinate student projects for competitions, bridging the gap between academic theory and hands-on practice. I am ready to apply this mix of technical skills and project leadership to the teams at a National Lab.
