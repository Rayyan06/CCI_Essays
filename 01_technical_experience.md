Prior to enrolling in an engineering program, as someone who was homeschooled K-12, I was always a self-directed learner. For example, when I was young, I learned C++, Python, Calculus, Arduino, etc on my own. When I worked at my Father's Engineering office, I was given the independence to pursue complex prototyping challenges such as an Optical Encoder and Foam Cutting CNC.

In my Engineering Design course, I have consistently taken on leadership responsibilities within Design Teams. The first project was a Mug Warmer, where I handled the design, calculations, and manufacturing. I worked with a high degree of independence, initially I chose to use ceramic resistors to warm the baseplate but I ended up changing that to Nichrome wire because it worked better. We did the calculations, then we made the design and we presented it, keeping a mug warm at 55C +- 5 degrees for 3 hours. The third project, the entire class was divided into sub-teams and collectively tasked to make a Turtle Mover Robot that would save Turtles from getting crushed by cars while crossing the road, a common problem here in upstate NY. I was placed on the Management team, whose responsibilities were to manage the project and facilitate communication between the sub-teams. The project started out strong, but we hit a critical hitch when no one made specifications for the robot. There seemed to be miscommunication, so I went up to the whiteboard and called an emergency meeting with the class team, organizing everyone to discuss this. This effort refocused the team on defining the specs and achieving a working functional prototype. Overall, I played a major role in the management team, writing the test document & spec documents, managing communication between the various sub teams, managing the Gantt Chart schedule for the project, and developing the Failure modes and Risk analysis (FMEA).

During the semester, I also became involved at a Hackathon at RPI. However, once I arrived there, my original teammates from my community college were unavailable, so I quickly adapted by partnering with a lone RPI student I met there. Despite not knowing him, we rapidly utilized our skill sets to develop a functional video game controlled by hand gestures!

Currently, as part of the IEEE club project, I'm working on the program code for a Self Balancing robot. While my independence in learning is a core strength, this year has taught me how to channel that drive into a collaborative team effort, something that will directly apply to working at a National Lab.
