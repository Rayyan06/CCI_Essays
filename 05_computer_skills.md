Engineering Software
SolidWorks 2022 & Fusion 360: Years of experience modeling mechanical parts for 3D printing and CAM. Designed components for Foam Cutting CNC and Optical Encoder. Used in class projects for rapid prototyping. Generated toolpaths to cut parts from Wood stock with a CNC machine.

NI LabVIEW 2018: Designed a Serial Interface to process high frequency Encoder Position Byte Data. Implemented a producer-consumer loop architecture to acquire, process, and visualize data on a live chart with minimal latency.

MATLAB: Modelled heat loss for a Mug Warmer Intro to Engineering Design Project, simulated vehicle dynamics for an RC car project, and solved matrix equations for Engineering Coursework.

KICAD: used for circuit board development. Went through the full process of making a schematic, adding symbols & footprints, laying out traces on circuit board and generating Gerber Files and BOM, ordering components and assembly from an online vendor. Familiar with Altium Designer Concepts.

Programming Languages

C/C++: Advanced Proficiency. Focus on microcontroller programming and GUI development. Wrote Interrupt Service Routines in AVR C to send high-frequency serial data, and C++ programs to receive it. Utilized object-oriented programming, complex data structures, and C++ STL library for C++ GUI programs with wxWidgets and Qt to create desktop engineering applications. Utilized I2C communication for self-balancing robot sensors.

Python: Used MatplotLib & Numpy for mathematical analysis and lab reports for classes. Experience with Django to create full stack web apps. Used PyQt5 and Tkinter for Engineering Software GUI development.

HTML/CSS/Javascript: Extensive experience developing web apps such as Ecommerce website, Data visualization from Serial Port. 
NodeJS: Experience developing websites with JS framework

Arduino IDE: Used for rapid prototyping and sensor integration prior to custom AVR C code implementation

Software Tools & Data
