Programming Languages

C / C++: Advanced Proficiency. Focus on microcontroller programming and GUI development. Developed Firmware using AVR-C; wrote Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) to send high-frequency serial data, and C++ programs on the receiving end to process incoming serial data, using serial communication drivers (Win32). Utilized object-oriented programming, complex data structures, and C++ STL library for C++ GUI programs with wxWidgets and Qt to create desktop engineering applications. Utilized I2C communication for self-balancing robot sensors.

Python: MatplotLib & Numpy for mathematical analysis and lab reports for classes. Experience with Django to create full stack web apps. Used PyQt5 and Tkinter for Engineering Software GUI development.

Java: Currently enrolled in CISS 110 (Spring 2026) covering fundamentals and OOP concepts.

HTML/CSS/Javascript: Extensive experience developing web apps such as Ecommerce website, Data visualization from Serial Port.
NodeJS: Experience developing websites with expressJS, RemixJS, and NextJS. Created .io game (online multiplayer game) using websockets.

Arduino IDE: Used for rapid prototyping and sensor integration prior to custom AVR C code implementation

Raspberry Pi: Set up a Minecraft server and developed sensor data collection projects using Python, GPIO, and I2C interfaces.

Linux(Bash/Shell): Assisted Computer Science students with environment setup, experience with Linux terminal basics and Bash commands.

Engineering Software
SolidWorks 2022 & Fusion 360: 3+ years modeling mechanical parts for 3D printing; CAD and CAM. Designed components for Foam Cutting CNC and Optical Encoder. Used in class projects for rapid prototyping. Generated G-code toolpaths to cut parts from Wood stock with a CNC machine.

NI LabVIEW 2018: Built a serial interface using producer-consumer architecture to acquire, process, and visualize high frequency encoder data with minimal latency.

MATLAB: Thermal modeling for Mug Warmer Project, vehicle dynamics simulation for RC car project, matrix analysis, and data visualization. Spring 2026: numerical simulation of differential equations, dynamic mechanical systems, and electric circuits.

KICAD: used for circuit board development. Went through the full process of making a schematic, adding symbols & footprints, laying out traces on circuit board and generating Gerber Files and BOM, ordering components and assembly from an online vendor. Familiar with Altium Designer Concepts.

LTSpice: Circuit Analysis course, currently enrolled.

Software Tools & Data

Microsoft Excel: Advanced proficiency. Utilized for Data Visualization, Regression Analysis, Pivot Tables, and filtering large datasets. Extensively used in Lab reports and in Engineering Design course to track project progress, technical specifications, and FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects) analysis as a member of the management team. Used in Engineering Tools course for Engineering Calculation Assignments.

Microsoft Office Suite: Used Word for technical reports and Documentation, PowerPoint for technical presentations, and OneDrive for file sharing for team & club projects.

Google Suite: Drive, Gmail, Sheets, and Slides for collaborative team projects.

Git & Github: Used for keeping track of Programming Projects with Version Control. Github Actions for deployments, CI/CD integration.
IDE(Integrated Development Environment): VS Code, Visual Studio(C++), and Microchip Studio (Embedded Projects)

Notion: Used for project management, task tracking
