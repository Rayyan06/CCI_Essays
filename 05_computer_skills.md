Engineering Software
SolidWorks 2022 & Fusion 360: Years of experience modeling mechanical parts for 3D printing and CAM. Used to create parts for making a Foam Cutting CNC, Optical Encoder casing, and Additionally, used in class projects for rapid prototyping. Additionally, used for toolpath generation to cut parts from Wood stock with a CNC machine.

NI LabVIEW 2018: Designed a Serial Interface to process high frequency Encoder Position Byte Data. Implemented a producer-consumer loop architecture to process and visualize data on a live chart without lag.

MATLAB: Modelled heat loss for a Mug Warmer Intro to Engineering Design Project, simulated vehicle dynamics for an RC car project, and solved matrix equations for Engineering Coursework.

KICAD: used for circuit board development. Went through the full process of making a schematic, adding symbols & footprints, laying out traces on circuit board and generating Gerber Files, ordering components and assembly from an online vendor.

Programming Languages

C/C++: Advanced Proficiency. Focus on microcontroller programming and GUI development. Used in Encoder Project for writing Interrupt Service Routines in AVR C to process high frequency data and push it to serial. Learnt object-oriented programming, data structures, and C++ STL library. Wrote C++ GUI programs with wxWidgets and Qt to create desktop engineering applications.

Python: Used MatplotLib & Numpy for mathematical analysis and lab reports for classes. Experience with Django to create full stack web apps. Used PyQt5 and Tkinter for GUI development.
HTML/CSS/Javascript: Extensive experience developing web apps such as Ecommerce website, Data visualization from Serial Port. 
NodeJS: Experience developing websites with JS framework
Arduino IDE: Used for rapid prototyping and sensor integration prior to custom AVR C code implementation

Software Tools & Data

Microsoft Excel: Advanced proficiency. Utilized for Data Visualization, Regression Analysis, Pivot Tables, and filtering large datasets. Extensively used in Lab reports & in Engineering Design course to track project progress as a member of the management team. Used in Engineering Tools course for assignments
Microsoft Office Suite: Used Word for technical reports, PowerPoint for technical presentations, and OneDrive for file sharing for team & club projects.
Git & Github: Used for keeping track of Programming Projects with Version Control.
Documentation: Collaborative editing for team-based project documentation
IDE's: VS Code, Visual Studio(C++), and Microchip Studio (Embedded Projects)
Notion: Used for project management, task tracking
