Homeschooled K-12, I mastered Calculus and Programming alone but lacked a roadmap. After a stagnant year working for my father, I realized I was limiting my potential and enrolled in community college.

Academically, I thrived, setting the curve in Calculus 2 and Physics. However, I struggled with collaboration. In my first Design Project, I sidelined my team to ensure we met specs. I received a 0% on a reflection exam for dismissing their input. The professor’s lesson was clear: prioritizing personal output over team input is failure.

I applied this to the Turtle Mover project. When the Manufacturing team began building without specs, I didn't fix it myself. I called an emergency meeting and facilitated a whiteboard session to align our requirements.

I realized that while I can solve calculus problems at my desk, I cannot build complex systems alone. I have outgrown solitary learning and am ready to bring this collaborative drive to RPI.
